Bantustan     a bantustan ( also known as a bantu homeland , black homeland , black state , or simply homeland ) was a territory set aside for south africa 's black inhabitants during apartheid . ten bantustans were established in south africa and ten more in south-west africa ( now namibia ) , with the goal of creating nation states for the black tribes of africa . the term `` bantustan '' comes from `` bantu '' ( meaning `` people '' in the bantu languages ) and `` -stan '' ( meaning `` land '' in persian ) . the founders of apartheid tried hard to make the bantustans recognised internationally , but this never happened , and most blacks did not like the bantustans . they were unpopular because : - the borders of the bantustans were drawn to exclude valuable land . - the large number of reassigned citizens combined with the small size of the bantustans meant that the citizen to land ratio was severely disproportionate to that of south africa . - becoming citizens of the new territories meant losing citizenship of south africa , where the majority of candidates for reassignment of citizenship lived and worked . this would cause them to lose what few rights and privileges they had as citizens of south africa .
