Vasodilation     vasodilation is where blood vessels widen . it results from relaxation of muscle cells within blood vessel walls . the process is essentially the opposite of vasoconstriction , which is the narrowing of blood vessels . when vessels widen , blood flow is increased . this in turn decreases blood pressure . drugs that cause vasodilation are called vasodilators .
