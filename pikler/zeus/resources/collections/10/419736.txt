Agilbert     agilbert ( flourished 650â€“ ) was frankish by birth and educated in ireland . he became the second bishop to the west saxons after bishop birinus . following a disagreement with king cenwalh of wessex he returned to gaul to eventually become the bishop of paris . agilbert studied in ireland for several years . in 650 he came to wessex as a . cenwalh , the king , was impressed by his background he offered agilbert the of dorchester . this was the seat originally given to bishop birinus who founded a church at dorchester on thames . birinus had died in 650 and cenwalh was looking for a replacement . but after some time cenwalh grew tired of not being able to understand the bishop , who apparently did not speak the anglo-saxon language . cenwalh created a new diocese at winchester in 660 and made wine the first bishop . agribert took offense at not being consulted and left his see . agilbert did not leave england immediately but visited northumbria . a controversy had occurred in the northumbrian church over the date of easter . the king oswiu of northumbria and his son eahlfrith each backed a different church position . why agilbert came to northumbria at this time or who sent him is not recorded . but kings osiwu and cenwalh were friends . they both supported the roman position that easter should be celebrated the same throughout the christian world . a synod was called at whitby to settle the issue . bishop agilbert was the senior there who supported the roman position . as he did not speak the language well , he asked wilfrid to speak for him . their argument was why did only the remote parts of britain celebrate easter differently than the remainder of the christian world ? osiwu made a decision to celebrate easter with the rest of the christian churches .
