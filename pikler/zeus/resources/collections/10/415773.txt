UDFj-39546284     udfj-39546284 is a 'stellar structure ' ( probably a galaxy ) reported january 27 , 2011 as light from the oldest object . it was detected through infrared observation by the hubble space telescope . it was reported in december 2012 to be at redshift z = 11.9 using hubble and spitzer telescope data , including hubble ultra-deep field ( hudf ) . the actual stellar source of the light detected no longer exists . the image is likely to correspond to a compact mini-galaxy of blue stars that existed as we see it 13.42 billion years ago , around `` 380 million years '' after the big bang ( estimated at 13.8 billion years ago ) . at the time of the announcement , it was the oldest galaxy found . it beat the previous distance record holder by about 150 million light years . with the revision of the distance , it again became the oldest galaxy found as of december 12 , 2012. the next attempt to see further will be the james webb space telescope launched sometime this decade . unlike udfy-38135539 , udfj-39546284 has not been spectroscopically confirmed . a galaxy first formed near to the end of the dark ages , it offers information from early after the big bang .
