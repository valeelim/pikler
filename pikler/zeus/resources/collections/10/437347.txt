Cylinder (firearms)    cylinder ( firearms ) a cylinder , in firearms terminology , is the cylindrical , rotating part of a revolver . the cylinder has multiple cartridges chambers . the cylinder revolves around a central shaft in the revolver . this is to bring each individual chamber into alignment with the barrel for firing . each time the gun is cocked ( made ready to fire ) , the cylinder rotates by one chamber making the pistol ready to fire again . cylinders typically hold six cartridgesâ€”which is why revolvers are sometimes called `` six shooters '' . but some small frame revolvers only hold five cartridges , due to the smaller overall size of the gun . several models of .22 rimfire caliber revolvers have cylinders holding nine or ten rounds . as a general rule , cylinders are not designed to be removed from the firearm except for cleaning . a speedloader or moon clip can be used with some revolvers for rapid reloading .
