Interstellar travel     interstellar space travel is manned or unmanned travel between stars . interstellar travel is much more difficult than travel within the solar system , though travel in starships is a staple of science fiction . actually , there is no suitable technology at present . however , the idea of a probe with an ion engine has been studied . the energy would come through a laser base station . given sufficient travel time and engineering work , both unmanned and sleeper ship interstellar travel seem possible . both present considerable technological and economic challenges which are unlikely to be met in the near future , particularly for manned probes . nasa , esa and other space agencies have done research into these topics for several years , and have worked out some theoretical approaches . energy requirements appear to make interstellar travel impractical for `` generation ships '' , but less so for heavily shielded sleeper ships . the main challenge facing interstellar travel is the vast distances that have to be covered . this means that a very great speed and/or a very long travel time is needed . the travel time with most realistic propulsion methods would be from decades to millennia .
