Cenwalh of Wessex     cenwalh , also spelled coenwalh ( 672 ) , was a king of wessex . he reigned from 643 until he was exiled by king penda of mercia in 645. restored to his kingdom in 648 he reigned until his death . he was a pagan king until his exile in east anglia when , like his father , he became a christian . cenwalh was the son of king cynegils . when his father died in 643 cenwalh succeeded him as king of wessex . he married a sister of penda of mercia who was the power in the region at that time . when cenwalh her ( set her aside ) in favor of another wife , penda invaded wessex . penda drove cenwalh into exile in east anglia . he remained in east anglia for three years with king anna of east anglia . there he learned about christianity and was baptised . while in exile , wulfhere , the son of penda , took a great deal of territory away from wessex . he gave the isle of wight to aethelwalh , king of sussex . cenwalh was restored to his kingdom . how he was allowed to return is not recorded . nor is it recorded who ruled wessex in his absence . but an entry in the anglo-saxon chronicle for the year 648 seems to indicate it might have been cuthred , the son of cwichelm . cenwalh gave cuthred three thousand hides of land ( 300â€“450 square miles ) of land at ashdown in berkshire . this may have been most , if not all , of berkshire . this was much larger than an estate a king might give a family member . cenwalh seems to have left the thames river basin as a result of pressure from mercia . that made berkshire his northern frontier with mercia .
