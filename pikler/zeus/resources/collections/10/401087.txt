Starburst galaxy     a starburst galaxy is a galaxy with a very high rate of star formation . the rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy will quickly use all of its gas reservoir ( from which the stars are made ) . so , the starburst nature of a galaxy is a short phase in a galaxy 's evolution . most starburst galaxies are in the midst of a galaxy merger or at least close encounter with another galaxy . studying nearby starburst galaxies can help us explore the history of galaxy formation and evolution . many very distant galaxies seen , for example , in the hubble deep field are known to be starbursts , but they are too far away to be studied in any detail . looking at nearby examples give us an idea of what was happening in the early universe . the light we see from distant galaxies left them when the universe was much younger ( see redshift ) . starburst galaxies seem to be quite rare in our local universe , and are more common further away . this suggests there were more of them billions of years ago . all galaxies were closer together then , and therefore more likely to be influenced by each other 's gravity . more frequent encounters produced more starbursts as galactic forms evolved with the expanding universe .
