Trichromacy     trichromacy is a type of colour vision . animals with this kind of vision see colours by means of cone cells in their retina . each of three types of cone cell are sensitive to a different range of light wavelengths . colour as perceived by us is constructed by our brain 's visual cortex . humans and many other primates have full colour vision . many other mammals do not , because they have only one or two types of cone cells , which do not collect such a wide range of wavelengths .
