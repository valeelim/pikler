Maclyn McCarty     maclyn mccarty ( june 9 , 1911 â€“ january 2 , 2005 ) was an american geneticist . he was best known for proving that dna , not protein , was the chemical basis of the gene . mccarty devoted his life to studying infectious disease organisms . studies of bacteria led the way to studying heredity through genetics and biochemistry . this started the age of molecular biology . mccarty was the youngest and longest surviving member of the research team responsible for the avery-macleod-mccarty experiment . he won the wolf prize in medicine for 1990. maccarty died on january 2 , 2005 , from congestive heart failure . the phenomenon was first described in griffith 's experiment of 1928 , which suggested dna was the material of heredity . in this early experiment dead `` streptococcus pneumoniae '' of the virulent strain type iii-s , was injected along with living but non-virulent type ii-r pneumococci . this resulted in a deadly infection of type iii-s pneumococci . this meant the non-virulent strain had been transformed ( changed ) by something in the dead bacteria .
