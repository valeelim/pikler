Braconid     the braconidae are a family of parasitoid wasps . they are one of the richest families of insects : there are between 50,000 and 150,000 species worldwide . the species are grouped into 45 subfamilies and about 1,000 genera . most braconids are parasitoids ( both external and internal ) on other insects . their victims are the larvae of coleoptera , diptera , and lepidoptera , and also some hemimetabolous insects such as aphids and bugs . most species kill their hosts , though some cause the hosts to become sterile and less active . the endoparasitoid species lay their eggs inside the victim . they have elaborate adaptations which improve larval survival inside the host . they have endosymbiotic viruses which disable the host immune defences . these polydnaviruses are often used by the wasps instead of a venom cocktail . the dna of the wasp actually has bits which are the templates for the viral particles . a study suggested these arrangements had started about 100 million years ago . these viruses suppress the larva 's immune system and allow the parasitoid to grow inside the host undetected . through the evolutionary history of being used by the wasps , these viruses apparently have become so modified , they appear unlike any other known viruses today . because of this highly modified system of host immunosuppression , a high level of parasitoid-host specificity is not surprising . in other words , the viruses need to be a bit different for every host species .
