Nyasasaurus     nyasasaurus ( `` lake nyasa lizard '' ) is an extinct genus of archosaur reptile from the middle triassic manda beds of tanzania . it may be the earliest known dinosaur . the discovery was a handful of bones from two individuals , so its anatomy is only partly known . the bones were collected in the early 1930s , but have only recently been analysed . researchers said : `` '' nyasasaurus '' possesses a unique combination of dinosaur character states and an elevated growth rate similar to that of definitive early dinosaurs . it demonstrates that the initial dinosaur radiation occurred over a longer timescale than previously thought ( possibly 15 million years earlier ) '' . the find was six vertebrae and a humerus from one specimen , and five vertebrae from another . the humerus has a muscle attachment which is characteristic of dinosaurs ( a long 'deltopectoral crest ' ) . other features are consistent with its being a basal dinosaur . previously , the oldest record of dinosaurs was from argentina and dated back to the upper triassic carnian stage , about 231.4 million years ago ( mya ) . `` nyasasaurus '' comes from a deposit that dates back to the middle triassic anisian stage , meaning that it predates other early dinosaurs by about 15 million years .
