Accusative case     the accusative case is part of the description of the grammar of a language . the accusative case is used where something happens to a pronoun or a noun in a sentence , so when it is the direct object . in the sentence `` '' he '' sees the woman '' , `` he '' is the subject of the sentence . in the sentence `` the woman sees `` him '' '' , `` him '' is the object . in english we use different forms of the pronoun : he/him . `` him '' would be the accusative case . if we use a noun , there is no difference in english . we use the same word `` man '' : the man sees the woman '' and `` the woman sees the man . in many other languages different forms of the word are used , depending on what function it has in the sentence - subject or object . for example , in latin . `` the man sees the woman '' = `` vir feminam videt '' , while `` the woman sees the man '' = `` femina virum videt '' . for `` man '' , latin uses `` vir '' for the subject , and `` virum '' for the an object . also , in the same sentences , we have `` femina '' for a subject and `` feminam '' for object . the form used for the direct object ( `` him '' , `` virum '' , `` feminam '' ) is known as the `` accusative case '' , while the form used for the subject ( `` he '' , `` vir '' , `` femina '' ) is known as the nominative case .
