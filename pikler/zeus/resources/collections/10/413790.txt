' she married steve kelly , an assistant of david berg whom berg had chosen as her 'consort ' before his death . steve kelly took the title of 'king peter ' and became the public face of tfi , speaking in a more public capacity than either david berg or karen zerby . in 1974 , the group began a method of evangelism called flirty fishing . this meant using sex to `` show god 's love '' and win converts . the method was apparently exrtemely successful . according to tfi , as a result of flirty fishing , `` over 100,000 received god 's gift of salvation through jesus , and some chose to live the life of a disciple and missionary '' .
