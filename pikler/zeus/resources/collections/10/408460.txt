Homotherium     homotherium is an extinct genus of machairodontine sabertoothed cats . their teeth are longer than a modern tiger , but shorter than `` smilodon '' . therefore , they are sometimes called `` scimitar-toothed cats '' . `` homotherium '' was widespread in north america , south america , europe , asia , and africa during the pliocene and pleistocene epochs ( 5 million years ago â€“ 10,000 years ago ) . it first became extinct in africa some 1.5 million years ago . in eurasia it survived until about 30,000 years ago . in south america it is only known from a few remains in the northern ( venezuela ) , in the mid-pleistocene . the last scimitar cat could have survived in north america until 10,000 years ago . what we have of evidence comes from the skeletons . from its teeth , its killing method would have been somewhat different from `` smilodon '' . the canines look like they were used for a stabbing action rather than slashing . the build of the body is much stronger at the front and heavier than modern cats , which suggests an ambush strategy . that in turn suggests cover in woodlands , which were very common in the pliocene and much of the pleistocene .
