Reaction intermediate     a reaction intermediate or simply intermediate is a molecule that is formed during a chemical reaction . it is not the final product , but it is something that is more like the product than the reactants . after every step in a reaction mechanism , an intermediate is formed . intermediates usually stay around for a little time because they are very reactive . however , it is important not to confuse an intermediate with a transition state . the latter is at a point of maximum energy . an intermediate instead is at a point of minimum energy , i.e . it is a stable molecule . intermediates can be isolated from a reaction if needed . for example , in the reaction : a + b → x → c + d x is the intermediate . in going from a + b to x and from x to c + d , the reaction will go through a transition state .
