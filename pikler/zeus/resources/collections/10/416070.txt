' it was probably a name already known in the english midlands and was adopted by the angles who settled there . the angles , according to bede , came from `` angulus '' in northern germany . they were of the same stock as the east anglians and the northumbrians . the invasion of england by the germanic tribes was relatively quick . by england was a large collection of small kingdoms each having a warlord or petty king . within 200 years of their arrival in england , the late seventh century , emerged the heptarchy : the seven kingdoms of anglo-saxon england . mercia was the dominant power among the anglo-saxons from the middle of the seventh century to the early ninth century . several mercian noblewomen played an important role in mercian affairs . this is in contrast to wessex where women rarely had an active role in the government . during the seventh and eighth centuries mercia struggled mainly with northumbria . by the ninth century wessex was the dominant power in the region . king egbert of wessex ( 802â€“839 ) was the overlord and for the first time passed this position down to his heirs . from this time on until they ceased to exist as a kingdom , mercia was a vassal kingdom to wessex . in the last quarter of the ninth century mercia lost much of its territory in the midlands to danish settlers .
