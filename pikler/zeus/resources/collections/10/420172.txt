DVD-Audio     dvd-audio is an audio format similar to the cd . it is commonly claimed to have higher audio quality than the cd . dvd-audio has not become popular due to the cost and rarity of the players , and because the traditional cd is considered good enough . tests have shown that the traditional cd already has the highest possible audio quality ; it is not possible to go any higher because the traditional cd can reproduce the entire audible frequency range . dvd-audio does , however , support surround sound , and many dvd-audio releases are available with surround sound . the traditional cd theoretically supports surround sound too , but , with the exception of dts and dolby surround-encoded cds , no surround-capable cd player has ever been made , and no surround-formatted cd has ever been released . dvd-audio supports multiple sample rates , including 44.1 ( same as cd ) , 48 ( same as dat and dvd-video ) , 88.2 , 96 , 176.4 , and 192 khz , with either 16 , 20 , or 24-bit encoding . surround sound is supported up to the 96 khz sample rate ; higher sample rates can only be in mono or stereo . dvd-audio also uses 56-bit encryption on the audio data ( dvd-video uses 40-bit css encryption and cd does not use encryption ) . the 56-bit encryption algorithm is a modified version of des . dvd-video content may be present on a dvd-audio disc to enable compatibility with video-only players . unlike super audio cd , there is no mechanism for compatibility with standard cd players .
