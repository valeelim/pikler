EMV     emv is a standard protocol for credit cards and debit cards . beforehand , such cards used a magnetic stripe to store information . this approach has two main problems : first , the amount of data that can be stored is relatively small . such a card can store about 1024 bits , or 128 bytes . the second problem is bigger : the data stored is not encrypted . using a chip card can solve both problems : it can store much more data , and the data can be encrypted . payment cards that use chips have been in use since the early 1990s . beforehand , each card issuer had their own protocol . with emv , the protocol has been standardised . the first version of emv as published in 1995 , there have been different versions since then .
