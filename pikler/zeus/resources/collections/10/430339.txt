Space observatory     a space observatory is any instrument ( such as a telescope ) in outer space which is used for observation of distant objects . planets , stars , galaxies , and other outer space objects may be viewed and recorded . this category does not include observatories in space which are pointed toward the earth for the purpose of reconnaissance and other types of information gathering . all observation of space from earth is filtered through the earth 's atmosphere . the atmosphere filters and distorts what is seen and recorded . space-based astronomy is vital for frequency ranges outside the optical and radio windows . for example , x-ray astronomy is nearly impossible when done from the earth . it has reached its present importance in astronomy due to orbiting x-ray telescopes . infrared and ultraviolet are also largely blocked by the atmosphere . most space observatories are in low earth orbit . in 1946 , american theoretical astrophysicist lyman spitzer was the first to propose a telescope in outer space , a decade before the soviet union launched the first satellite , `` sputnik '' .
