Teredo tunneling     in computer networking , teredo is a tunneling protocol used to give ipv6 connectivity to a computer with only an ipv4 connection . the ipv6 address block 2001:0 : :/32 is used with teredo . unlike similar protocols such as protocol 41 , teredo works correctly only if the ipv4 network has a network address translator ( nat ) . teredo is available on windows xp and later , and is enabled by default on windows vista and later . it is also available on linux and unix , with a program called miredo . teredo was named after `` teredo navalis '' , commonly called a shipworm , which creates holes or tunnels in wooden ships . a teredo address might look like : 2001:0:4136 : e378:8000:63bf:3fff : fdd2 . this address has the teredo server 65.54.227.120 , the client ipv4 address 192.0.2.45 , and the udp port number 40000 .
