Lucrezia Borgia     lucrezia borgia ( 18 april 1480 â€“ 24 june 1519 ) was the daughter of pope alexander vi , and his long-term mistress vannozza dei cattanei . her brothers included cesare borgia , giovanni borgia , and gioffre borgia . lucrezia 's family was typical of the ruthless machiavellian politics and sexual corruption of the times . it was alleged to be characteristic of the renaissance papacy . lucrezia was cast as a `` femme fatale '' , a role seen in many artworks , novels , and films . very little is known for sure about lucrezia . whether she was involved in the political activities of her father and brothers is unclear . they certainly arranged several marriages for her to important and powerful men . presumably , this helped their own political ambitions . lucrezia was married to giovanni sforza ( lord of pesaro ) , alfonso of aragon ( duke of bisceglie ) , and alfonso i d'este ( duke of ferrara ) . tradition has it that alfonso of aragon was an illegitimate son of the king of naples and that her brother cesare may have had him murdered when his political value faded .
