Short sale     in real estate , a short sale is a way for a homeowner to avoid a foreclosure . in both situations , the homeowner is at least several months behind on payments . in a foreclosure , the bank or lending institution seizes the house , and they now own it and have to try to sell it themselves ( or through an agency ) . in a short sale , the homeowner agrees with the bank to sell it for less than it is worth on the market . the banks would maybe agree to this because it means the house will get sold , saving them the selling responsibility . but they are losing money , because the house is selling for less than it is worth . sometimes , they make the homeowner pay the balance , and sometimes they forgive it . short sales are not always a great deal because of the highly inflated prices of the housing bubble . for example , if a house that normally costs $ 100,000 was suddenly 'valued ' at $ 200,000 , and someone got a loan for that amount , they would want to re-sell it for $ 200,000 or even more to make a profit . however , values dropped . so now , they may short sell ( less than it is worth ) the house for $ 175,000 , and lose $ 25,000 . but to a new buyer , that $ 100,000 house is probably still not worth $ 175,000 . so see what the average is for that house over time .
