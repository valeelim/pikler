Geosynchronous orbit     a geosynchronous orbit is an orbit at a height of above sea level on the earth . at this height , the orbit takes 24 hours , so it is `` in sync '' with the land on earth ( the 'geo ' part of geosynchronous ) . the geostationary orbit is the most common type of geosynchronous orbit . this is right above the equator , so the satellites in this orbit do not swing north or south , but stay perfectly still above a point on the equator . this is useful for communication satellites ( including satellite tv ) . geosynchronous also includes orbits that are not above the equator , but since every orbit goes around the center of the earth , the satellite must spend an equal amount of time north of the equator as it does south of the equator , so it appears to slide up and down when viewed from the earth .
