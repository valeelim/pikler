Electrostatic loudspeaker     an electrostatic loudspeaker is a design of speaker . the sound is generated by force placed on a membrane suspended in an electrostatic field . the electrostatic loudspeaker is almost like magnetostatic loudspeaker but it does not use high currents , it uses high voltages . the membrane ( a thin film ) is controlled by voltage , and it moves between metal plates which are full of small holes . the sound quality from modern models of electrostatic loudspeaker is good .
