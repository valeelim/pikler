Catopuma     catopuma is a genus containing two small asian felines , the bay cat ( `` c. badia '' ) and the asian golden cat ( `` c. temminckii '' ) . the bay cat is sometimes classified as `` pardofelis bardia '' , and the marbled cat is also in that genus . because the genetic evidence is that all three cats are closely related , they will probably all be put in `` catopuma '' eventually . the bay cat and the asian golden cat are typically reddish brown in colour , with darker markings on the head . they live in forests in south east asia . the bay cat is only found on the island of borneo .
