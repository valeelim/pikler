Ring of Brodgar     the ring of brodgar is a neolithic henge and stone circle on mainland , the largest island in orkney , scotland . it is part of the unesco world heritage site known as the heart of neolithic orkney . the stone circle is in diameter , and the third largest in the british isles . the ring originally comprised 60 stones , of which only 27 remained standing at the end of the 20th century . the tallest stones stand at the south and west of the ring . the stones are set in a circular ditch up to deep , wide and in circumference that was carved out of the solid sandstone bedrock by the ancient residents . technically , this ditch does not constitute a true henge as there is no sign of an encircling bank of earth and rock . however , many archaeologists refer to this structure as a henge . aubrey burl classifies the ditch as a class ii henge ; one that has two opposing entrances , in this case on the north-west and south-east . the ring is in a significant ritual landscape . within there are the two circle-henges , four chambered tombs , groups of standing stones , single stones , barrows , cairns , and mounds . a number of flint arrowheads and broken stone mace-heads were found nearby . they seem to date from the bronze age . the nearby standing stones of stenness and its maeshowe tomb help to make the ring of brodgar a site of major importance .
