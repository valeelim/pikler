Ethnic conflict     an ethnic conflict ( or ethnic war ) is a conflict where different ethnic groups fight each other . it is different from a civil war , where a single nation or ethnic group is fighting among itself . examples of ethnic wars since the 1990s were typically caused by secessionist movements leading to the breakup of multi-ethnic states along ethnic lines : the yugoslav wars , the first chechen war , the nagorno-karabakh war , the rwandan civil war and the war in darfur , among others academic explanations of ethnic conflict generally fall into one of three schools of thought : primordialist , instrumentalist or constructivist . intellectual debate has also focused around the issue of whether ethnic conflict has become more common since the end of the cold war , and on finding ways of managing conflicts , through instruments such as consociationalism and federalisation .
