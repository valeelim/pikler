Educational psychology     educational psychology is a branch of psychology . it has ancient roots , but was mostly developed in the 20th century . it has two `` faces '' , the scientific and the humanistic . education as an objective science was strongly promoted around 1900 by alfred binet and edward thorndike . binet it was who invented the first intelligence tests , and they were extended and promoted in english by louis terman . binet 's ideas were sympathetic to thorndike , who was above all interested in turning psychology into a real science by research , measurement and empirical evidence . the arrival of world war i caused a huge conscription of men into the fighting services . sorting out men of all types was an urgent problem . the intelligence tests proved to be very useful at helping get the right men into the right jobs . not surprisingly , the use of iq tests continued in education , where a similar problem of sorting out occurs in unselected public school enrollments . the other way to look at educational psychology is to notice that a child is a growing person . unlike most adults , the child is open to influence . education does change a child . the emphasis on the child as a growing person is typical of humanistic psychology . it has many supporters , especially at primary school level . examples of educators whose interest was humanistic include johann pestalozzi , maria montessori , john dewey , and jean piaget . this type of approach is called `` child-centered '' education .
