Athelred of Wessex     athelred or æthelred ( – ) was king of wessex from 865 to 871. he succeeded his brother ethelbert at the time of the invasion of england by the great heathen army . he was the first of the four sons of athelwulf not to rule as before he became king of wessex . athelred was the fourth son of king athelwulf and his wife osburga . she was the daughter of oslac , athelwulf 's butler . while his father was in rome and france , 855-856 , his oldest brother athelstan had died . prior to his death two years later athelwulf left a will . in that will the two eldest sons , ethelbald and ethelbert should have the kingdom . when ethelbald died in 860 , ethelbert became the king of wessex . but their father 's will had made no provision for athelred and alfred , the two youngest sons , to be kings . possibly for that reason ethelbert did not appoint his brother athelred king of kent . he consolidated everything into the single kingdom of wessex . in 865 vikings raided into kent and the men of kent agreed to pay them ransom . but the vikings the eastern part of kent despite the pending treaty .
