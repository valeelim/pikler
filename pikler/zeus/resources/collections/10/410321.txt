Maine (province)    maine ( province ) maine is one of the traditional provinces of france . it 's capital was the city of le mans . the area is now divided into the departments of sarthe and mayenne . the carolingians called maine `` pagis cenomannicus '' after the cenomani tribe that julius caesar had defeated . pepin the short gave the duchy of maine to his half-brother grifo . in the last half of the 9th century , maine took on greater importance because of invasions from normandy and brittany . in 924 king rudolph of france gave maine to rollo of normandy . because it was next to anjou on the south and normandy on the north , these two duchies often fought over maine . william , duke of normandy invaded maine in 1063 and he controlled the county by the beginning of 1064. norman control of maine helped make the southern border of normandy safe against anjou . this was a factor which allowed duke william to launch his successful invasion of england in 1066. in 1069 the citizens of le mans revolted against the normans . soon some of the manceaux barons joined the revolt . the normans were expelled in 1070 , and young hugh v was made the count of maine . after norman attacks in 1073 , 1088 , 1098 and 1099 , elias i succeeded his cousin hugh v , who sold maine to him in 1092 for ten thousand shillings . his daughter married fulk v , count of anjou , who took maine over in 1110 after the death of elias . henri beauclerc , agreed to recognize him as count of maine .
