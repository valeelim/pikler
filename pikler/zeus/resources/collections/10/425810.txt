Absolute threshold of hearing     the absolute threshold of hearing ( ath ) is the minimum loudness of a pure tone that an average ear with normal hearing can hear with no other sound present . the absolute threshold relates to the sound that can just be heard by the organism . this is also known as the auditory threshold . the threshold of hearing in humans is 20 µpa ( micropascals ) = 2×10 pascal ( pa ) . the tympanic membrane of the ear operates as a sound pressure sensor , as does a microphone measurement of the absolute hearing threshold provides some basic information about our auditory system . the tools used to collect such information are called psychophysical methods . because human hearing is more sensitive to some frequency bands than others , thresholds vary depending on the frequency of the stimulus tone .
