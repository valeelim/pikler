Coding theory     coding theory is the study of properties of codes and how good they are for a use in the real world . codes are used for data compression ( where data is made smaller ) , cryptography ( where data is changed into a form that not everyone can read ) , and error correction . codes are studied by different scientific disciplines for designing data transmission methods that are efficient and reliable .
