Herman Kahn     herman kahn ( february 15 , 1922 â€“ july 7 , 1983 ) was one of the preeminent futurists of the second half of the twentieth century . his theories helped to develop the nuclear strategy of the united states . kahn , a man of `` captivating personality and large intellectual gifts '' , worked for the rand corporation , santa monica , california , as a military strategist ( 19481958 ) . he was a founder of the hudson institute think tank . this gives ideas and consultations for the u.s. government and military chiefs , and for business clients . he was known for analyzing the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommending ways to improve survivability . his key idea was that the threat of nuclear war could be controlled by the use of carefully graded deterrence . in order to get his ideas across he ran two-day seminars which included role-playing in various scenarios . his ideas , when published in `` on thermonuclear war '' , caused a sensation . however , responses must be proportionate , because if one threatened all-out war as a response for some rather modest misbehaviour , then the threat was simply not believable , and would not work . the need to think things through in detail was the topic of his second book , `` thinking about the unthinkable '' .
