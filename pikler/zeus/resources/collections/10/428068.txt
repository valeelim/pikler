Cognitive neuropsychology     cognitive neuropsychology is a subject in psychology . it is a combination of biology and cognitive psychology . these psychologists study human behavior and knowledge . this is a growing subject that is used more and more everyday . unlike cognitive neuroscience , cognitive neuropsychology pays attention to the mind rather than the brain . many scientists have worked to make cognitive neuropsychology . their findings have created an understanding of the brain and how humans learn and do things . most of these scientists were not psychologists , but are known for their contributions to psychology . the technology today also helps advance what is known . with brain imaging and other methods the brain can now be visualized . cognitive neuroscience can also be broken into different topics such as memory , attention , language , and emotion . the early history of cognitive neuropsychology begins with humans â€™ first acknowledgement of the mind/brain . beliefs in the importance of the mind/brain/head emerge as early as 4000bc with the sumerians . records of sumerian intake of the poppy plant ( which contains opium ) include descriptions of the mind-altering affects upon ingestion . this suggests a reference to the brain . another clue pointing towards acknowledgement of the brain is the discovery of skulls with holes drilled into them in 2000bc . discovery of these skulls points to cultural acknowledgement of the brain as important to life . the motivation behind these drillings could vary from spiritual to medical .
