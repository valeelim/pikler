Crossing the Rubicon     crossing the rubicon is a metaphor similar to `` burning one 's bridges '' and `` the point of no return '' . it means passing a decisive point , where one can not turn back . it comes from a genuine historical incident . the rubicon is a shallow river in north-east italy . according to roman tradition and law roman legions could not be brought south of the river without permission of the roman senate . in 50 bc , the senate , led by pompey , ordered julius caesar to disband his army and return to rome because his term as governor of gaul had finished . caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate . pompey accused caesar of insubordination and treason . caesar and his army approached rome and `` crossed the rubicon '' in 49 bc . it was the point beyond which no army was supposed to go . the river marked the boundary between cisalpine gaul to the north , and italy proper to the south . pompey , the lawful consul , and his friends , fled from rome as caesar 's army approached . so began a civil war in which caesar eventually triumphed .
