Carat (purity)    carat ( purity ) the carat is a unit of measurement for gold alloys . in that context , one carat gold means that the twenty-fourth part of an alloy is gold , the other parts are made of other metals , generally silver or copper . pure gold would be soft , which makes it unusable for many purposes . alloyed gold is harder than pure gold and so more suitable for applications such as jewellery . an alloy that has 24 carat actually contains 99.9 percent gold , 18 carat gold contains 75 percent gold . sometimes , a scale up to 1000 is used ; as an example , gold 585 mean there is 58.5 percent gold in the alloy . this means that `` gold 585 '' actually contains 14 carat .
