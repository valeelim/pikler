Observable universe     in big bang cosmology , the observable universe is what , in theory , can be seen from earth . that is light , or other signals , which has had time to reach the earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion . the observable universe is a spherical volume ( a ball ) centered on the observer , regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole . every place in the universe has its own observable universe , which may or may not overlap with the one centered on earth . the word `` observable '' does not depend on whether modern technology actually allows detection of radiation from an object in this region . it simply means that it is possible `` in principle '' for light or other signals from the object to reach an observer on earth . in practice , there is much that we can not see . we can see light only from as far back as when particles were first able to emit photons that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles . before then , the universe was filled with a plasma that was opaque to photons .
