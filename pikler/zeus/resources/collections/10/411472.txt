Boulton Paul Defiant     the boulton paul defiant was a british fighter aircraft . this single-engine , aircraft first in august 1937 and was used by the british royal air force in world war ii . defiants were different to other fighter planes because their guns ( four machine guns ) were in a rotating turret and could fire in any direction . they had two crew : one man was the pilot and the other aimed the guns . defiants were made to shoot down enemy bomber aircraft . when they were used during the battle of britain , they were good at this . but they were slower and could not turn as well as german fighter planes , like the messerschmitt bf 109. a lot of defiants were shot down by german fighters . after the battle of britain , the british only flew defiants at night . in this way they could attack the german bombers that also flew at night , and avoid the german fighters because they only flew during the day . today , only one defiant is left in the world ; it is in a museum in london .
