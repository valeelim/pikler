Electric power distribution     electric power distribution is the delivery system of electricity to places that use it , such as homes and other buildings . it is done mainly by power lines , transformers , substations and meters . the electricity comes from the power station at high voltage and is delivered at medium to low voltage levels . in early days , electricity was distributed as direct current ( dc ) . alternating current ( ac ) was later introduced during the war of currents . dc distribution disappeared because transformers can easily convert ac to high voltage for electric power transmission and low voltage to use at home . configurations . - radial network - loop network
