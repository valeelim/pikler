Mixed forest     mixed forests are a temperate and humid biome . the forests have four layers . the uppermost layer is the forest canopy of tall , mature trees from 33 to 66 m ( 100 to 200 feet ) high . below the canopy is the three-layered understory , about 9 to 15 m ( 30 to 50 feet ) shorter than the canopy . the top layer of the understory has smaller mature trees , saplings . there are also suppressed juvenile canopy layer trees waiting for an opening in the canopy . below the sub-canopy is the shrub layer of low-growing woody plants . most of the time , the lowest growing ( and most diverse ) layer is the ground cover or herbaceous layer .
