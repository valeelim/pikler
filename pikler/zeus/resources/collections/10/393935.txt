Speedometer     a speedometer is a type of gauge that shows the speed a vehicle is moving . it usually shows the speed in miles per hour ( mph ) for countries that use the statute mile for distances or kilometres per hour ( kph ) for countries that use the metric system . originally , a speedometer was an option that car owners could buy to put on their car . beginning about 1910 it was built into all cars . the electric speedometer was invented by the croatian josip belušić in 1888 , and was originally called a velocimeter . charles babbage is credited with creating an early type of a speedometer . these were usually fitted to locomotives . a spedometer was patented by a german , otto schulze on october 7 , 1902 , it uses a rotating flexible cable usually driven by gearing linked to the output of the vehicle 's transmission . the early volkswagen beetle and many motorcycles , however , use a cable driven from a front wheel . most speedometers have tolerances of some ±10 % , mainly due to variations in tire diameter . sources of error due to tire diameter variations are wear , temperature , pressure , vehicle load , and nominal tire size . vehicle manufacturers usually calibrate speedometers to show the vehicle is going faster .
