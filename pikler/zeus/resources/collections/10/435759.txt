Aretino Records     aretino was an american record label . it was in business from about 1907 to 1914. aretino was started by arthur j. o ’ neill . he started many record and phonograph businesses in the chicago area . o ’ neill named this company in honor of guido aretino , an 11th-century italian monk . aretino is an odd type of record because the hole in the center is very large compared to the normal size . it is the largest ever for a record that was made for people to use in their houses . like many of o'neill 's other companies , aretino was run as a premium scheme . a phonograph ( record player ) was offered for not much money . however , this record player could only play aretino records because it came with a 3-inch spindle . o ’ neill also offered adapters for aretino discs . these allowed the discs to be played on record players that had normal spindles , or even on a busy bee machine ( another o ’ neill brand ) which had two spindles instead of one . aretino did not make any of its own recordings : it borrowed masters from other companies . the first series of aretino records had music on only one side of the disc . they were each given a catalog number beginning with the letter a. the music was recorded on them by leeds & catlin . leeds and catlin also made a group of records for aretino with catalog numbers starting with the letter d. these records have a recording on both sides . they are very hard to find now . leeds & catlin was later shut down by court order for patent infringement . after that , aretino records were made for a short time by two record companies named hawthorne & sheble and zonophone . these companies kept making records which only had music on one side of the record . they also kept using catalog numbers beginning with `` a '' .
