Land reclamation     land reclamation is the idea of getting new land . it is usually done in coastal areas . sometimes it is also done in areas like rivers and lakes . usually , there is a natural process which fills such areas with sand , dirt and other materials . land reclamation uses the same process , which is sped up . in many cases , this is done using dikes . an example where land reclamation is done is the ijsselmeer in the netherlands . pioneer plants , such as salicornia or ammophila grow there . when the level of the land is as high as that of the high tide , new ditches are dug , and the process can repeat . sometimes , it is too time-consuming to wait for the land to rise . in that case , it is possible to pump out the water in the enclosed area . this was done in the netherlands , where many areas are below sea level . the problem with this approach is that it needs to be repeated , for example in the case of heavy rainfall . few examples are kansai airport in osaka , japan . thumb the creation of large , artificial islands , such as palm islands in dubai or maasvlakte , which is part of the port of rotterdam is not known as land reclamation .
