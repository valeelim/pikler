Ambrosius Aurelianus     ambrosius aurelianus was a powerful romano-british leader in sub-roman britain around mid-5th century . he has been identified with the legendary king arthur by historians like john morris . ambrosius aurelianus was born in roman britain in the years when roman legions withdrew from the british isles and started the anglo-saxon conquest . he seems to be born in a noble roman family , resident in britain for many generations . he also appeared independently in the legends of the britons , beginning with the 9th-century `` historia brittonum '' , written by nennius . his importance comes from the fact that he is the `` only romano-british leader '' named by gildas , who was the only historian who lived during sub-roman britain times : this fact makes ambrosius aurelianus an historical and `` real '' personality in the king arthur legends . he was renowned for his campaigns against the anglo-saxons , and there is some speculation that he ( or his son , according to the historian gildas ) may have commanded the romano-british forces at the battle of badon hill , where the barbarians were won around 500 ad . after this battle for fifty years the anglo-saxons were stopped fron conquering all britain .
