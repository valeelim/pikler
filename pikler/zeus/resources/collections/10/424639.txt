Stop codon     a stop codon is special sequence in the genetic code . it is a nucleotide triplet in messenger rna that signals the end of translation . it is a codon ( that is , a sequence of three nucleotides in messenger rna ) . it indicates the end of a gene . similar to how a full stop indicates the end of a sentence , a stop codon signals the end of genetic translation . they are also called termination codons or chain termination codons . there are three such codons : uaa , uag and uga . proteins are based on polypeptides , which are unique sequences of amino acids . most codons in messenger rna correspond to the addition of an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain , which may ultimately become a protein . stop codons indicate the end of this process , and therefore , the end of polypeptide synthesis .
