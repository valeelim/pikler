Bloodletting     bloodletting is the practice of withdrawing blood from a patient to cure a disease . the practice was widely used in antiquity and the middle ages . people stopped using it in the 19th century . the idea of bloodletting comes from an ancient system of medicine called humorism : this system states , that there are different `` humors '' in the body . to remain healthy , a patient had to keep these humours in balance . bloodletting was the most common medical practice performed by physicians from antiquity until the late 19th century , a span of almost 2,000 years . it was found that only in very few cases , this treatment helps cure a disease . the practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific conditions . there was no other treatment for hypertension . bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume . the problem with hypertension is that it is difficult to diagonse from its symptoms . modern methods directly measure blood pressure . in antiquity , this effect was therefore unintentional . in most cases , the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients .
