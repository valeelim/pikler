The Steadfast Tin Soldier     `` the steadfast tin soldier '' is a literary fairy tale by hans christian andersen . the story was first published in copenhagen , denmark by c.a . reitzel on 2 october 1838 in the first booklet of `` fairy tales told for children . '' the booklet includes andersen 's `` the daisy '' and `` the wild swans '' . the story was andersen â€™ s first story not based upon a folk tale or a literary model . `` the steadfast tin soldier '' has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated movie . the story tells of a tin soldier who loves a paper ballerina . he falls from the window in the toy room . after many adventures , he is returned to the toy room . a little boy throws the tin soldier in the fire . a breeze blows the paper ballerina into the fire . the two toys are destroyed together . joan g. haahr writes in `` the oxford companion to fairy tales '' : `` the story is unusual among andersen 's early tales , both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities . blind fate , not intention , determines all events . moreover , the narrative questions the very decorum it praises . the tin soldier 's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him , while exemplifying pietistic ideals of self-denial , also contributes to his doom . were he to speak and act , the soldier might gain both life and love . restrained , however , by inhibition and convention , he finds only tragedy and death . the tale is often read autobiographically , with the soldier viewed as symbolizing andersen 's feelings of inadequacy with women , his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes , or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider , from full participation in everyday life .
