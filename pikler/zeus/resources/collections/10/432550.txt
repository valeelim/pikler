Numerical integration     numerical integration is the term used for a number of methods to find an approximation for an integral . numerical integration has also been called quadrature . very often , it is not possible to solve integration analytically , for example when the data consists of a number of distinct measurements , or when the antiderivative is not known , and it is difficult , impractical or impossible to find it . in such cases , the integral can be written as a mathematical function defined over the interval in question , plus a function giving the error . one way to find a numerical integral is using interpolation . very often these interpolating functions are polynomials .
