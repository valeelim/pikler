Money (Pink Floyd song)    money ( pink floyd song ) `` money '' is a song by the english progressive rock band pink floyd . the song was on their 1973 album `` the dark side of the moon '' . it was written by their bassist/co-lead singer roger waters , and it was the first song on the second side of the original album . money is the only song on the album to enter the top 20 on the `` billboard '' hot 100 . `` money '' is noted for its unusual 7/4â€“4/4 time signature , and the sounds of money-related objects that begins the song . one of gilmour 's ideas for the solo section was that , for the second chorus of the solo , all special effects would be completely off ( referred to as `` dry '' ) , creating the sense of just four musicians playing in a small room . for this `` dry '' chorus , all musicians played softly and subtly , with gilmour 's solo , now one single guitar , playing very little . then , for the third chorus , the dynamics would suddenly rise , with heavy use of reverb and echo ( a `` wet '' sound ) , additional rhythm-guitar parts in the background , and the drums becoming heavy and almost chaotic .
