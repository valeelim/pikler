Digital Compact Cassette     the digital compact cassette ( dcc ) was a format of magnetic tape , developed to replace the compact cassette . it competed with the minidisc and the digital audio tape ( dat ) , but neither format could replace the compact cassette . it was marketed as a cheaper alternative to dat . equipent for the digital compact cassette was able to play back compact cassettes as well ; recording could only be done to dcc , though . unlike dat , dcc uses lossy data compression . this means that the copy of the data is not identical to the original . audio data could be compressed to about 25 percent of its original size . the main problem of the format was tied to handling : finding a song in the middle of a 90 minute tape takes several minutes , with minidisc it is instantaneous . minidisc allows to delete or move tracks , features which the digital compact cassette can not offer . even though some of the features were addressed ( like rewinding a 90 minute tape in less than a minute ) , the format never gained much marketshare . the compression format used by dcc is based on mp1 , which was a predecessor of mp3 . the cd-r , which is compatible with standard cd players , eventually replaced both dcc and minidisc for home audio recording . the cd-r also replaced analog tape .
