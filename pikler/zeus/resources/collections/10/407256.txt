New Zealand parrot     the stringipoidea is a small superfamily of new zealand parrots . it only has three genera : `` nestor '' , the kakapo `` strigops '' and the fossil `` nelepsittacus '' . the genus `` nestor '' consists of the kea , and the kaka , while the genus `` strigops '' contains the iconic kākāpō . all living species are endemic to new zealand . the modern common species names , kea , kākā and kākāpō , are the same as the original māori names . the nearby island species , the norfolk kaka and the chatham kaka , became extinct in recent times . the extinct species of the genus `` nelepsittacus '' have been extinct for 16 million years . all living forms are threatened . human activity caused the two extinctions and the decline of the other three species . settlers introduced invasive species , such as pigs and possums , which eat the eggs of ground nesting birds . also hunting for food , killing as agricultural pests , habitat loss , and introduced wasps have added to the problem . the family diverged from the other parrots around 82 million years ago when new zealand broke off from gondwana , and the ancestors of the genera `` nestor '' and `` strigops '' diverged from each other between 60 and 80 million years ago .
