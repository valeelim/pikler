Lagrange point     a lagrange point is a special type of place where the gravity is stable . this is used with two objects in space where the smaller object orbits around the bigger one , like the earth and the sun , or the moon and the earth . there are five places where a small object ( like a man-made satellite ) can orbit , and the effects of gravity from the larger objects and the centripetal forces balance out . ( centripetal force is the push outward that comes from spinning around ) . so a small satellite can stay in the lagrange point without ever needing fuel to stay in orbit . it is named after the mathematician joseph-louis lagrange , who wrote a paper on this in 1772 ( long before we put satellites into orbit ) . dust clouds and asteroids can also stay in these points . the five places are called l1 , l2 , l3 , l4 and l5 . the first three ( l1 , l2 , l3 ) are called unstable because if a satellite gets a bit out of place , it will fall away from that point , and not come back without using fuel . l4 and l5 are considered stable - if a satellite gets a bit out of place , it will be pulled back into place by the gravity and centripetal forces .
