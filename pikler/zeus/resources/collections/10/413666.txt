Darwin's finches    darwin 's finches darwin 's finches are a group of birds that live on the gal√°pagos islands . they are not actually finches , but they are a kind of passerine bird . charles darwin used the finches to provide evidence for natural selection . he realized that the finches have different beaks because they are adapted to eat different kinds of food . for example , a finch with a big beak is very good at cracking open nuts , and a finch with a long beak is very good at catching insects . darwin was able to see that the finches had a common ancestor which is why they were so similar except for their beaks . eventually , this led to the theory of evolution .
