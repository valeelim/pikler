Varistor     a varistor , vdr , `` ( voltage dependent resistor ) '' is a type of resistor . it controls the current depending on the voltage . in these devices resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage . once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold , there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries , which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred ohms . the major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy , and they self resetâ€“after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold , its resistance returns to being high . this makes them ideal for surge-protection applications . as there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance , they find use in all sorts of applications . the best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical substations , where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes . they have rapid response , are low maintenance , and do not appreciably degrade from use , making them virtually ideal devices for this application .
