Stereotype threat     stereotype threat is the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs . claude steele introduced this idea in 1995. stereotype threat may reduce the performance of people who belong to a negatively stereotyped group . claude steele and joshua aronson did research for this theory of social psychology . they had african-american and european-american college students take a difficult verbal portion of the graduate record examination . the design was a 2x3 factorial . the factors were the race of the participant ( black or white ) and the test description ( diagnostic of intelligence , non diagnostic , or non diagnostic and challenging ) . performance on the test was the dependent variable . 117 male and female participants were recruited from stanford university . after comparing the results of the three groups , it was found that the differences were not very significant . however , in their second study results were significant . a study on chess players shows that if females are made aware of the stereotype that females are worse at chess than males , they perform worse than the controls . stone , lynch , sjomeling , & darley did experiments in which white men performed poorly in sports if they are put in the condition that described the task as reflecting natural athletic ability compared to african-americans . the african-americans performed worse when the task was described as involving intelligence of the sport .
