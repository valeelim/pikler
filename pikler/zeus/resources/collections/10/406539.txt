Surcoat     a surcoat , or surcote , was an outer garment commonly worn in the middle ages by both men and women . it can either mean a coat worn over other garments or the outer garment commonly worn over armour . the name comes from the french meaning `` over the cotta '' , a long , wide coat reaching down to the feet without sleeves . starting about the 12th century , knights wore long and flowing surcoats over their armour . they would often show the coat of arms of the wearer . a knight 's surcoat reached almost to the ankles . it had slits ( cuts ) in the bottom front and back so a wearer could sit . it also had no sleeves . one purpose for the surcoat was to protect armour from the rain . another use was during the crusades to keep the armour cooler in the sun . by the middle of the 14th century the long surcoat was replaced with the `` jupon '' ( or `` gipon '' ) . this was a much shorter garment , which was often padded for extra protection . once suits of plate ( solid ) armour became common , the surcoat was no longer used .
