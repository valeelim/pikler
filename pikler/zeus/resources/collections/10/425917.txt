Dutch resistance     the dutch resistance was a movement of dutch people who fought against the nazi occupation of the netherlands during world war ii . they fought the nazis in many different ways , mostly without using violence . the resistance helped to hide 300,000 people in the autumn of 1944. dutch resistance developed slowly . in 1941 , dutch people organized a strike , called the february strike , to protest against the nazis deporting over 400 jews . this encouraged the resistance . the dutch communists set up a system of cells ( small groups of resistance members ) . some other very amateur groups also formed , like de geuzen , set up by bernard ijzerdraat . some military groups started , such as the ordedienst ( 'order service ' ) . most groups were discovered by the nazis during the first two years of the war . dutch resistance groups gathered counterintelligence ( information about the nazis ) , committed sabotage , and formed communications networks . this helped the allied forces , beginning in 1944 and continuing until the netherlands was liberated . about 75 % ( 105,000 out of 140,000 ) of dutch jews were killed in the holocaust , most of them murdered in nazi death camps . a number of resistance groups specialized in saving jewish children . somewhere between 215 and 500 dutch romanis were also killed by the nazis .
