Agnotology     agnotology is a branch of science which looks at the ways in which doubt or ignorance about certain subjects is created . a very good example of how this happens is the publication of scientific studies that rely on data that is inaccurate or misleading . more generally , the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before . the neologism was coined by robert n. proctor , a stanford university professor specializing in the history of science and technology . proctor cites the tobacco industry 's conspiracy to manufacture doubt about the cancer risks of tobacco use as a very good example of how this can be done . under the banner of science , the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty . the way in which media attention works can be exploited to produce ignorance . other factors that influence it are that corporations or governments do not reveal certain facts . at times , they force these facts to be removed if they have been revealed . the methods they use include censorship , destroying documents , putting the weight of certain facts differently , or being inattentive or forgetful .
