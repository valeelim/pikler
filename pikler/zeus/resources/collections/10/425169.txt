Body armour     modern body armour ( personal armour/armor or body armor ) is protective clothing . it is designed to absorb and/or deflect slashing , bludgeoning , and penetrating attacks . it was first used to protect soldiers , today it is used to protect riot police , private security guards and bodyguards . there are two different types of armour . there is regular non-plated personal armor used by most police , security guards and bodyguards . there is also hard-plate reinforced personal armor , which is used by combat soldiers , police tactical units and hostage rescue teams . armour is certainly very ancient , but it was little used in infantry warfare for quite a long time , with the exception of helmets . from about the 18th century to the vietnam war , men fought relatively unprotected . the weight and cost of effective armour meant it was no longer practical to have infantrymen armoured . the invention of carbon fibre , modern hard ceramics and various plastic compounds are suitable for light armour which is effective in many circumstances . kevlar , technora and nomex are aramids , which are long-chain aromatic polyamides . they are used to make bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks . the pasgt helmet and vest used by united states military forces since the early 1980s both have kevlar as a main component , as do their replacements . most of these items have padding on the inside to act as shock-absorbers , and to increase comfort during while being worn .
