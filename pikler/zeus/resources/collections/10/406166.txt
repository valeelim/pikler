Antoni Gaudí     antoni gaudí i cornet ( 25 june 1852 – 10 june 1926 ) was a spanish architect . he was born in reus , in catalonia , and became a leader of catalan modernism . gaudí 's works are in his own style . most are in the catalan capital of barcelona , especially his greatest work , the sagrada família . he got some ideas from neo-gothic art , art deco and oriental techniques , and became part of the modernist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . between 1984 and 2005 , seven of his works were declared world heritage sites by unesco . the seven works were : the park güell , the palau güell and the casa milà ; the nativity facade , the crypt and the apse of the sagrada família , the casa vicens and the casa batlló in barcelona , and the crypt of the colònia güell in santa coloma de cervelló . gaudí 's roman catholic faith grew during his life , and religious images are found in his work . this earned him the nickname `` god 's architect '' , and eventually led to his beatification in 2011. his work had a style inspired by nature . gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works , instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he was conceiving them .
