Luyten 726-8     luyten 726-8 ( uv ceti or gliese 65 ) is a binary star which is one of earth 's nearest neighbours . it is about 8.7 light years from earth in the constellation cetus . one of the pair , uv ceti , was the archetype for the class of flare stars . the star system was discovered in 1948 by w.j luyten in the course of compiling a catalogue of stars of high proper motion ; he noted its exceptionally high proper motion of 3.37 arc seconds annually and catalogued it as luyten 726-8. the two stars are of nearly equal brightness , with apparent magnitudes of 12.57 and 11.99 as seen from earth . they orbit one another every 26.5 years . the distance between the two stars varies from 2.1 to 8.8 au . its own nearest neighbour is tau ceti , away from it . both the stars are variables . the most spectacular is luyten 726-8b , which was given the variable star designation uv ceti . although uv ceti was not the first flare star discovered , it is the most prominent example of such a star , and similar flare stars are now known as uv ceti type variable stars . this star goes through fairly extreme changes of brightness : for instance , in 1952 , its brightness increased by 75 times in only 20 seconds . uv ceti is a red dwarf of spectral type m6.0e .
