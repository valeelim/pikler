Poseur     poseur ( or poser ) is a negative term used by some subcultures . it describes a person who copies the style or mannerisms of a subculture , but who is not considered to belong to it . it implies that the person is fake , and is considered not to share or understand the values or philosophy of that culture . a person may copy the style of a particular subculture to be accepted within that group or for popularity among various other groups . the term is often used in the punk , heavy metal , hip hop , and goth subcultures , or the skateboarding and surfing communities . for example , in the hardcore punk scene , older punks may view a young punk with an `` anarchy '' symbol on their shirt as a poseur if the older punks think the young punk does not understand what the symbol means .
