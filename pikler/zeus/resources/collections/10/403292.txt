Acrylic paint     acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint containing pigment in an acrylic polymer emulsion . acrylic paints can be diluted with water , but are water-resistant when dry . depending on how much the paint is diluted ( with water ) or modified with acrylic gels , media , or pastes , the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting , or have its own unique appearance . acrylic paint can give a much brighter , more vivid colour than oil paints . it has been much used in modern art , and is cheaper than oil paint , which is rather an expensive material . when dry , acrylic paint usually can not be removed from a solid surface . in 1934 , a german chemical company created acrylic resin . it was first used in the 1940s . acrylics were commercially available as paint for artists in the 1950s . later , many advances were made to acrylic paint as more and more people began using it .
