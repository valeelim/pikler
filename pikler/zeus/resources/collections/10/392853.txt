Tutu (plant)    tutu ( plant ) tutu is a common name of māori origin for plants in the genus `` coriaria '' ( coriariaceae ) found in new zealand . six new zealand native species are known by the name : - `` coriaria angustissima '' - `` coriaria arborea '' - `` coriaria lurida '' - `` coriaria plumosa '' - `` coriaria pteridoides '' - `` coriaria sarmentosa '' they are shrubs or trees ; some are endemic to new zealand . most of the plant parts are poisonous , containing the neurotoxin tutin . both the seeds and sap of tutu are highly poisonous , resulting in many cattle deaths in the early days of european settlement . after removing the poisonous seeds , māori people prepared a drink from the fruit , which they often boiled with a type of seaweed ( rimu ) . the resulting jelly ( rehia ) was then fermented . honey containing tutin can be produced by honey bees feeding on honeydew produced by sap-sucking vine hopper insects ( `` scolypopa australis '' ) feeding on tutu . the toxin is in the sap of the tutu bush . this sap is eaten by the hoppers , but not all is digested . the undigested sap which contains a lot of plant sugars as well as tutin is excreted as honeydew onto the leaves of the bush . bees then gather the honeydew and toxic honey is the result .
