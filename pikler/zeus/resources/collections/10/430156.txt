Biphobia     biphobia is the fear of or bad treatment of bisexual people . biphobia is different from homophobia . for example , a person might be accepting of women who are attracted to women , but not accepting of women who are attracted to men and women . gay men and lesbian women as well as heterosexual men and women can be biphobic . bisexual people may feel like their sexual orientation is less real than that of a monosexual ( person who is attracted to one gender ) . this is internalized biphobia . a biphobic stereotype is that bisexual people have more sex than monosexual people . some people associate bisexuality with polyamory . bisexual women may be called nymphomaniacs . another belief is that bisexuality does not exist . some people think that bisexual people are heterosexual or homosexual people who are confused . in may 2013 the results of the european union lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender survey were released . they found that bisexual people are discriminated against at work more than gay men .
