Schwarzschild radius     the schwarzschild radius , or gravitational radius is the radius of a sphere that has certain properties : if all the mass of an object is compressed within this sphere , the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light . an example of an object smaller than its schwarzschild radius is a black hole . once a stellar remnant collapses below this radius , light can no longer escape and the object is no longer visible . it is a characteristic radius associated with every quantity of mass . the `` schwarzschild radius '' was named after the german astronomer karl schwarzschild who calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916 .
