Z3     the z3 was an electromechanical computer designed by konrad zuse . it was the world 's first working programmable , fully automatic digital computer . the z3 was built with 2000 relays , implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5â€“10 hz . program code and data were stored on punched film . the z3 was completed in berlin in 1941. the german aircraft research institute used it to perform statistical analyses of wing flutter . zuse asked the german government for funding to replace the relays with fully electronic switches , but funding was denied during world war ii since such development was deemed `` not war-important '' . the original z3 was destroyed in 1943 during an allied bombardment of berlin . a fully functioning replica was built in the 1960s by zuse 's company , zuse kg , and is on permanent display in the deutsches museum . the z3 was turing-complete . because of this machine and its predecessors , konrad zuse is often regarded as the `` inventor of the computer '' .
