GSSP     a gssp , more fully a global boundary stratotype section and point , is an internationally agreed point which defines the start of a stage on the geologic time scale . the work is done by the international commission on stratigraphy , a part of the international union of geological sciences . as of 2012 , 64 of the 101 stages that need a gssp have been decided . a geologic section has to follow the rules to be adapted as a gssp by the ics . the list below are the rules : - a gssp has to decide the lower boundary ( start of a geological period ) of a geologic stage . - the lower boundary ( start of a geological period ) has to be decided using a primary ( main ) marker ( usually first appearance datum of a fossil specie ) . - there should also be secondary markers ( other fossils , chemical , geomagnetic reversal ) . - the horizon in which the marker appears should have minerals that can be radiometrically dated . - the marker has to have regional and global correlation in outcrops of the same age - the marker should be independent of facies .
