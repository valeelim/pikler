Balk     a balk is something that a pitcher does in baseball that is not allowed , or illegal . if a balk happens the umpire will point to the pitcher and yell `` balk '' , and the runners on base get to move up one base . if there are no runners on base , a ball is issued to the batter . some ways a balk can happen include ; - the pitcher faking a pitch - the pitcher throwing the ball to a base where there is no runner . - pitching the ball before everyone is ready - the pitcher takes too long to pitch - if the pitcher drops the ball , even if he did n't mean too there are other ways it can happen , but these are the main ones .
