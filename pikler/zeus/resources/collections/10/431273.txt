Egocentrism     egocentrism is a state of mind of putting oneself in the center of interest , of being interested more about oneself than about other people . while this is normal in young children , it becomes more and more of a problem , in older children , adolescents and adults . to egocentric people , self-relevant information is seen as more important in shaping one â€™ s judgments than are thoughts about others and other-relevant information . the term egocentrism was mostly coined by piaget , a psychologist . egocentrism is different from both egoism and narcissism . young children are egocentric : they see themselves as the `` center '' of the world . developing self-conscience requires the perception that there are others , that there is socialistion with other people , and that there are differences between oneself and other people . egocentric people are often unable to fully understand or to cope with other people 's opinions . the fact that reality can be different from what they are ready to accept is difficult for them .
