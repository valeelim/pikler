Magic realism     magic realism , or magical realism , is a genre where magical events invade a realistic environment . it is the surprise effect of magical realism probably stems from the western reader 's separation from mythology . mythology is a root of magical realism more easily understood by non-western cultures . a characteristic of magic realism is the way a novel might start with a mundane , even boring situation . so , in mikhail bulgakov 's short story `` diaboliad '' , we find the central character sitting at an office in a typical soviet organisation : gradually things start to go wrong ... and before long , the events seem quite unbelievable . yet , underneath , some accurate truths about russia in the 1920s are strongly hinted . the genre has been applied to other art forms , but it is mostly used about fictional literature .
