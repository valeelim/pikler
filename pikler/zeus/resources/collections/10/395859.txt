Orbital inclination     orbital inclination is a term for the angle between two orbital planes . it is often used to describe the movement of celestial bodies such as stars and planets . in that context , one of the planes is the standard , or reference . many stars are in a galaxy that has a galactic plane which is used as reference . for a planet 's orbit , the inclination is the angle to the ecliptic plane . for a moon , an inclination of 0 degrees means the orbiting body orbits the planet in its equatorial plane , in the same direction as the planet rotates .
