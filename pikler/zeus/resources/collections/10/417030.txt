List of figures in Greek mythology     this is a list of gods , goddesses , people and other figures from greek mythology . they are sorted into sections below . the immortals include gods ( deities ) , spirits and giants . being immortal means that they live forever . the mortals include heroes , kings , amazons and other people . the list does not include creatures . these figures are described by ancient writers , the oldest of which are homer and hesiod . the greeks created images of their deities for many reasons . a temple would house the statue of a god or goddess , or several deities . the statue might be decorated with relief scenes depicting myths . these were also often painted on pottery and minted on coins . roman mythology includes many of the same figures , but uses different names : calling zeus by the name of jupiter and aphrodite by the name of venus , for example . the main and most important gods were the twelve olympians . the home of these gods is at the top of mount olympus . there was some variation as to which deities were included in the twelve . as such , the list below numbers fourteen . it includes all those who are commonly named as one of the twelve in art and poetry . dionysus was a later addition ; in some descriptions , he replaced hestia . hades is not usually included among the olympians , because his home was the underworld . some writers , however , such as plato , named him as one of the twelve .
