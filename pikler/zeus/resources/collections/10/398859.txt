Wader     wader is a common term in ornithology for birds which walk about in shallow water . sometimes they are called shore-birds . they are members of the order charadriiformes , which are water birds . the charadriiformes also includes marine-going seabirds with webbed feet . the evolutionary relationships of these birds are very complicated . most waders live in wetland or coastal environments . many species of arctic and temperate regions are strongly migratory , but tropical birds are often resident . some of the arctic species , such as little stint , are amongst the longest distance migrants , spending the non-breeding season in the southern hemisphere . most species eat small invertebrates picked out of mud or exposed soil . different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat without direct competition for food . many waders have sensitive nerve endings at the end of their bills which let them detect prey hidden in mud or soft soil . some larger species , especially those adapted to drier habitats , take larger prey like insects and small reptiles .
