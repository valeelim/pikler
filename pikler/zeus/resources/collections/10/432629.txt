Streptomyces     streptomyces is the largest genus of actinobacteria . over 500 species of `` streptomyces '' bacteria have been described . they are bacteria , but their manner of growth makes them look like fungi . they form long thin threads or hyphae . however , they are not related to fungi as with other actinobacteria , streptomycetes are gram-positive and have genomes with high gc content . mostly the bacteria live in soil and decaying vegetation and produces spores as its method of reproduction . streptomycetes produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin ( e.g. , tetracycline , neomycin and chloramphenicol ) . the now uncommonly used streptomycin takes its name directly from `` streptomyces '' . `` streptomyces '' is the largest antibiotic-producing genus , making antibacterial , antifungal , and antiparasitic drugs . they also make a wide range of other bioactive compounds , such as immunosuppressants . almost all of the bioactive compounds produced by `` streptomyces '' are made while the hyphae are forming from the substrate mycelium .
