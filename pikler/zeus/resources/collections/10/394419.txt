'' the cast includes the capricious miss havisham , the cold and beautiful estella , the kind and generous blacksmith joe , the dry and sycophantic uncle pumblechook , and the eloquent and wise herbert pocket . throughout the narrative , typical dickensian themes emerge : wealth and poverty , love and rejection , and the eventual triumph of good over evil .
