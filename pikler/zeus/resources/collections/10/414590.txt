Caledonian Forest     the caledonian forest is a type of woodland that once covered vast areas of scotland . today , parts of the original forest survive , covering in 84 places . the forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife , much of which is not found elsewhere in the british isles . the caledonian forests were formed at the end of the last ice age . trees began to recolonise what is now the british isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the english channel . forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of great britain for a short period . then the climate began to warm and the pinewoods retreated north into the scottish highlands . the highlands are the last remaining climatic region suitable for them in the british isles . the native pinewoods which formed this westernmost outpost of the boreal forest of europe are estimated to have covered as a vast wilderness of scots pine , birch , rowan , aspen , juniper , oak and a few other species . on the west coast , oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns , mosses and lichens .
