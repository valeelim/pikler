Battle of Ellandun     the battle of ellandun ( also spelled ellendun ) was fought in 825 between the armies of egbert of wessex and beornwulf of mercia . although costly to both sides , king egbert won . the battle effectively brought an end to mercian in southern england . it gave wessex over the remaining anglo-saxon kingdoms in the south . a century later the kingdom of wessex became the kingdom of england . during the 8th century and early 9th centuries , the kings of mercia exercised varying degrees of overlordship over the kingdoms of south-eastern england . some even ruled other kingdoms directly . while wessex had at times been obliged to recognise the power of mercian kings there was usually a strong resistance to allowing them to directly rule wessex . beorhtric of wessex ( 786–802 ) had probably received help from offa of mercia ( 757–796 ) in becoming king of wessex . in 789 he married eadburh , offa 's daughter . for the remainder of his rule wessex was subordinate to mercia . at the time beorhtric became king , egbert was also a claimant . edgar was exiled for a time from wessex and spent most of his time at the court of charlemagne . on the death of beorhtric egbert returned and succeeded to the throne . at this time coenwulf of mercia ( 796–821 ) was king and he concluded a peace treaty with wessex .
