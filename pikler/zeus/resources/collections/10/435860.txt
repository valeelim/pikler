Constant function     in mathematics , a constant function is a function whose output value is the same for every input value . for example , the function formula_1 is a constant function because the value of formula_2 is 4 regardless of the input value formula_3 ( see image ) . formally , a constant function `` f '' ( `` x '' ) : r→r has the form formula_4 . usually we write formula_5 or just formula_6 . - the function `` y '' = '' c '' has 2 variables `` x '' and `` у '' and 1 constant `` c '' . ( in this form of the function , we do not see `` x '' , but it is there . ) - the constant `` c '' is a real number . before working with a linear function , we replace `` c '' with an actual number . - the domain or input of `` y '' = '' c '' is r. so any real number `` x '' can be `` input '' . however , the output is always the value `` c '' . - the range of `` y '' = '' c '' is also r. however , because the output is always the value of `` c '' , the codomain is just `` c '' . example : the function formula_7 or just formula_8 is the specific constant function where the output value is formula_9 . the domain is all real numbers ℝ. the codomain is just { 4 } . namely , `` y '' ( 0 ) =4 , `` y '' ( −2.7 ) =4 , `` y '' ( π ) =4 ... no matter what value of `` x '' is input , the output is `` 4 '' .
