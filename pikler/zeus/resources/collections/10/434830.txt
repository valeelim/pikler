Duke of Orléans     the title duke of orléans is an old french dukedom that was highly regarded whilst the country was a monarchy . the title was usually used by a younger son of a reigning king and was passed from father to son . during the reign of louis xiv of france the title was used by his only broth philippe who as a `` son of france '' was known simply as `` monsieur '' . at the death of philippe in 1701 the dukes only held the rank of prince of the blood but maintained their rank due to being descended from a son of a previous king . the holder of the title was entitled to be addressed as your serene highness but this was used in writing only . the present day house of orléans is descended from this line and takes its name from the prestigious title . as princes of the blood they ranked above that of the princes of condé the princes of conti as well as the count of soissons . the dukes main seat was the palais royal in paris and the lavish château de saint cloud outside the capital as well as countless other residences . the duke and his wife were also entitled to their own apartment in the palace of versailles .
