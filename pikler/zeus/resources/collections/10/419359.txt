C major     c major is a major scale based on c , which is made up of the pitches c , d , e , f , g , a , b . its key signature has no flats or sharps ( see below : scales and keys ) . its relative minor is a minor , and its parallel minor is c minor . a scale in both c major and a minor can be played on a piano or other keyboard instrument using only the white keys . most of the time key signatures were cancelled whenever the new key signature had fewer sharps or flats than the old key signature , in modern popular music , this is only done when c major or a minor replace another key .
