Callanish stones     the callanish stones are near the village of callanish ( gaelic : calanais ) on the west coast of lewis in the outer hebrides ( western isles of scotland ) . the site was built between 2900 and 2600 bc , though there were possibly earlier buildings before 3000 bc . a tomb was later built into the site . the 13 primary stones form a circle about 13 m in diameter , with a long approach avenue of stones to the north , and shorter stone rows to the east , south , and west . the overall layout of the monument recalls a distorted celtic cross . the individual stones vary from around 1 m to 5 m in height , with an average of 4 m , and are of the local lewisian gneiss . the first written reference to the stones was by lewis native john morisone , who in c. 1680 wrote that `` great stones standing up in ranks [ ... ] were sett up in place for devotione '' . the tallest of the stones marks the entrance to a burial cairn where human remains have been discovered . an excavation campaign in 1980 and 1981 showed that the burial chamber was a late addition to the site , and that it had been modified a number of times .
