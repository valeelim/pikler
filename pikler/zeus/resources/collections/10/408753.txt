Volcanic plug     a volcanic plug is a landform created when volcanic magma hardens inside a vent on an active volcano . they are sometimes called volcanic necks or `` puys '' . the plug is revealed when surrounding land is eroded . as it forms , a plug may cause an extreme build-up of pressure if gas-charged magma is trapped beneath it . this sometimes leads to an explosive eruption . but if the explosion does not occur , then the volcano becomes a solid block made of hard material . the plug is usually harder than the surrounding rock . glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side , while a long slope of material remains on the lee side . such landforms are called crag and tail . if a plug is preserved , erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains . this is what produces the distinctive upstanding landform . related pages . - intrusion
