Chemical nomenclature     a chemical nomenclature is a set of rules for creating a system of names ( `` nomenclature '' ) for chemicals . this is done so that everyone uses the same name for a chemical . the system used most often around the world today is the one created and developed by the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) . the iupac 's rules for naming chemical compounds are written in a series of books . the system for naming organic compounds is written in the `` blue book '' . the system for naming inorganic compounds is written in the `` red book '' . a third book , called the `` green book '' , gives recommendations about the use of symbols for physical quantities . a fourth book , the `` gold book '' , contains the definitions of many of the technical terms used in chemistry . similar books exist for biochemistry , analytical chemistry , macromolecular chemistry , and clinical chemistry . the books do not cover everything , however . shorter recommendations for specific circumstances are published sometimes in the journal `` pure and applied chemistry '' .
