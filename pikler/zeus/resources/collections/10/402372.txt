Vegetative reproduction     vegetative reproduction is a kind of asexual reproduction . it can be found in plants , and lower organisms , for example unicellular organisms . it occurs naturally , and can also be caused on purpose by horticulturists . vegetative reproduction uses mitosis . this means that the newly created cell is a clone , and identical to the parent cell . by this process , new plants can be grown naturally without any seeds or spores . therefore , it is widely used especially in agriculture to spread the trees that are of great value to the economy . when it occurs naturally , it can be in different ways . some plants put out new roots underground , have bulbs , or grow new vines and shoots above ground . in gardening and farming , vegetative reproduction means cutting a tree branch below its center joint , planting it in some other earth , and letting it form new roots . in this way , many kinds of useful plants can be easily reproduced without any seeds , for example : apple , avocado , banana , cacao , hemp , orange/lemon , date , fig , grape , almond , pineapple , potato , strawberry , sugar cane and tea .
