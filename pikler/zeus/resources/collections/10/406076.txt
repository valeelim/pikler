Price controls     in economics , price control is the idea that the government fixes the prices that can be charged for a given product or service , in a given market . the government either fixes an absolute price that is charged , or a price range , with a minimum and a maxium . usually this is done so that goods such as staple food remain affordable . it can also be done to avoid people charging way too much for a good or service , which is known as price gouging . another field where it is done is to ensure a minimum wage or salary that employers must pay . the problem with the approach is that according to the law of supply and demand , the price of a good or service depends on its supply compared with the demand for it . if the price is fixed below the price the market would normally ask , the demand will increase - the product is `` cheaper '' than it should be . in general , the supply is fixed- at some point it is not possible to increase the production , and the supply . in the long term , it will therefore not be possible to meet the demand , and there will be a shortage .
