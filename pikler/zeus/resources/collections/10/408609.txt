Impact event     an impact event is a collision between objects in space . they happen regularly in planetary systems , such as our solar system . they most often involve small objects , such as asteroids , comets or meteors . these have relatively little impact . when a large object collides with a planet like the earth , it can have serious effects on the planet . depending on the size of the object , much of the impact is reduced by the planet 's atmosphere . smaller objects explode or break apart as they enter the atmosphere . these are seen as bolides . impact craters , which are caused by impact events , can be seen on many of the planets and other objects in the solar system . some of the largest are on mars and the moon . these are said to be evidence of major impact events . the first time an impact event was recorded was in july 1994. a comet , shoemaker–levy 9 , broke apart and collided with jupiter . the collision was recorded by telescopes and satellites . impact events appear to have had a major effect on the how the solar system has changed since it was formed . major impact events have also shaped the history of the earth , including the evolution of life . it is thought that the chicxulub impact , which happened 66 million years ago , caused the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event . there is debate over whether impacts caused any of the other extinction events throughout history . a giant impact event is thought to have produced the moon .
