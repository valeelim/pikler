Canonical form     in mathematics and computer science the term canonical form , or sometimes normal form refers to the usual representation of a mathematical object . for example , the canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero . mathematics has defined equivalence relations for some objects . these equivalence relations say that certain classes of objects are `` equal '' . these objects then belong to the same equivalence class . in such a case , a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class . for example , row echelon form and jordan normal form are canonical forms for matrices .
