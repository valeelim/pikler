Neopilina     neopilina is a mollusc , the only surviving genus of monoplacophora . some molecular results show that they fall within the polyplacophora clade , although these have been called into question . fossil and morphological data show that they are rather derived and bear very little resemblance to an 'ancestral mollusc ' . the monoplacophora were well-known as a fossil group from the cambrian to the devonian . they were thought to be long extinct . one species was dredged up from the pacific ocean off mexico in 1952. it was found to be a monoplacophoran , and given the genus of `` neopilina '' . this was one of the most remarkable modern discoveries of a 'living fossil ' , and a lazarus taxon .
