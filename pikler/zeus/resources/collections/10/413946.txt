Harmonic analysis     harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics that looks at the theoretical foundations of digital signal processing . a continuous signal can be drawn as a wave , or as a combination of several waves . fourier transforms and fourier series are among the main tools used for signal analysis . today , this field has many uses , which also include quantum mechanics and neuroscience . in essence , harmonic analysis looks at locally compact groups . the lebesgue measure is a way to assign a measurement to a subset of the euclidean space . for real numbers there is the haar measure , which can perform this task . this measure allows to use fourier analysis to model the groups and their properties . the term `` harmonics '' is also related to eigenvalues , in the case where the frequency of one wave is an integer multiple of the frequency of another wave . this is the case of the harmonics that are used for musical notes . later the term was generalized .
