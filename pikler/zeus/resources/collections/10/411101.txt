Sample     in statistics a sample is part of a population . the sample is carefully chosen . it should represent the whole population fairly , without bias . the reason samples are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical . therefore , solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling . sampling is about choosing which data to take for later analysis . as an example , suppose the pollution of a lake should be analysed for a study . depending on where the samples of water were taken , the studies can have different results . as a general rule , samples need to be random . this means the chance or probability of selecting one individual is the same as the chance of selecting any other individual . in practice , random samples are always taken by means of a well-defined procedure . a procedure is a set of rules , a sequence of steps written down on paper and followed to the letter . even so , some bias may remain in the sample . consider the problem of designing a sample to predict the result of an election poll . all known methods have their problems , and the results of an election are often different from predictions based on a sample . if you collect opinions by using telephones , or by meeting people in the street , the sample always has bias . therefore , in cases like this a completely neutral sample is never possible . in such cases a statistician will think about how to measure the amount of bias , and there are ways to estimate this .
