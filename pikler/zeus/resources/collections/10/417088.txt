Ribonuclease     ribonuclease ( commonly abbreviated rnase ) is a type of enzyme that chops rna into smaller parts . there are many different versions of the enzyme . all organisms studied contain many rnases of many different sorts . this shows that rna degradation is a very ancient and important process . 1. it cleans up cell rna which is no longer needed . 1. it is a first-line defence against rna viruses . 1. it acts in rna interference ( rnai ) , or post transcriptional gene silencing ( ptgs ) . this is a biological process in which rna molecules inhibit gene expression . in 2006 , andrew fire and craig mello shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on rna interference .
