Filter (electronics)    filter ( electronics ) electronic filters are electrical circuits which perform signal processing functions , specifically to remove unwanted frequency components from the signal , to enhance wanted ones , or both . electronic filters can be : - passive or active - analog or digital - high-pass , low-pass , bandpass , band-reject ( band reject ; notch ) , or all-pass . - discrete-time ( sampled ) or continuous-time - linear or non-linear - infinite impulse response ( iir type ) or finite impulse response ( fir type ) the most common types of electronic filters are linear filters , regardless of other aspects of their design . digital filters use a fourier transform .
