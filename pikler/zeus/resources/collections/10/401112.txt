Baby boom galaxy     the baby boom galaxy is a starburst galaxy 12.2 billion light years away . it was discovered by nasa 's spitzer science center at the california institute of technology . the galaxy is the new record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe , its brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate . the baby boom galaxy has been called `` the extreme stellar machine '' because it is seen producing stars at a surprising rate of up to 4,000 per year . our milky way galaxy turns out an average of just 10 stars per year . at its rate , the galaxy needs only 50 million years to grow into an equivalent of the most massive galaxy ever observed . the discovery challenges the accepted model for galaxy formation . this has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies , rather than growing internally . another unusual aspect is the fact that scientists are observing this galaxy at a time when the universe was only a little over 1.4 billion years old . evidently , the galaxy was doing this when the universe was still in its infancy .
