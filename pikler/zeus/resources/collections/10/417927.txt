Afrosoricida     afrosoricida is an order of mammals , which includes the tenrecs and the golden mole . tenrecs look like hedgehogs in appearance . golden moles look like moles . sequence analysis found that these animals are not closely related to other insectivores . some biologists use tenrecomorpha as the name for the tenrec-golden mole clade , but gary bronner and paulina jenkins argue that afrosoricida is more appropriate , despite their misgivings about the similarity between the name `` afrosoricida '' and the unrelated shrew subgenus `` afrosorex '' .
