Sabbath     a sabbath is a day reserved for rest or prayer , usually each week . the word `` sabbath '' comes from the hebrew word `` shabbat '' ( ) . this word is built from the hebrew root `` sh-b-t , '' meaning rest . in the hebrew bible , or `` tanakh , '' the root `` sh-b-t '' is used to describe god resting on the seventh day . this is the day after he finished creating the universe . in the bible , the idea of `` shabbat , '' or `` sabbath , '' as a holy day of rest starts there . remembering and keeping sabbath is also one of the ten commandments . from that , the abrahamic religions ( judaism , christianity and islam ) all have a tradition of a holy day of rest or prayer set aside every week : friday ( muslim ) , saturday ( jewish ) , and sunday ( christian ) . these three days are now very different from each other . the days of rest and prayer include : - `` shabbat '' , or `` shabbath '' in judaism . jews observe the sabbath on saturday . - sabbath in christianity . christians observe sabbath on sunday rather than saturday . - `` jumu'ah '' in islam . this is a communal or sabbath prayer that muslims hold every friday , just after noon .
