Provenance     provenance , from the french `` provenir '' , `` to come from '' , refers to the history of ownership , or the position of a historical object . the term was originally used in relation to works of art . it is now used in a wide range of fields , including archaeology , paleontology , archives , manuscripts , printed books , and science and computing . the main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery . this has a special value to help authenticate objects , to prove what they are . provenance is essentially a matter of documentation . in archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to `` provenance '' . archaeological researchers use `` provenience '' to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site , whereas `` provenance '' covers an object 's complete documented history . ideally , in modern excavations , the provenience or find spot is recorded ( even videoed ) with great precision , but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known , especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded . an object may have both a provenience ( where it was found ) and a provenance ( where it has been since it was found ) . in some cases , especially where there is an inscription , the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground , as well as its history after rediscovery .
