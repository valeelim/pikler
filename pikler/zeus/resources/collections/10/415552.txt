Centaurus A     centaurus a or ngc 5128 is a prominent galaxy in the constellation of centaurus . it was discovered in 1826 by scottish astronomer james dunlop at his home in new south wales , australia . ngc 5128 is either a hubble type lenticular galaxy or a elliptical galaxy . it is 1016 million light-years away . ngc 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to earth . its active center has been well studied . the galaxy is the fifth brightest in the sky , and is an ideal amateur astronomy target . the galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere . spitzer space telescope studies have confirmed that centaurus a is colliding with , and devouring , a smaller spiral galaxy . like other starburst galaxies , the collision produced the intense burst of star formation . the center of the galaxy has a supermassive black hole . its mass is about 55 million solar masses . this ejects a relativistic jet with emissions in the x-ray and radio wavelengths . astronomers have taken radio observations of the jet ten years apart . they found that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half the speed of light . x-rays are produced further out as the jet collides with surrounding gas . this produces highly energetic particles . the radio jets of centaurus a are over a million light years long .
