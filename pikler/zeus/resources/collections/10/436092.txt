Solid geometry     solid geometry is the geometry of three-dimensional euclidean space . it includes the measurements of volumes of various solid figures ( three-dimensional figures ) . these include pyramids , cylinders , cones , spheres , and prisms . it is euclidean geometry , but not plane geometry . points are defined as a defined position on a sphere . a `` staight line '' is the shortest path between two points which stays on the surface of the sphere . euclid 's account of spherical geometry is in his elements volumes xixiii containing solid geometry , and in his lesser-known work the `` phaenomena '' , which includes 25 geometric propositions . the actual discoveries were often made by others . the pythagoreans dealt with the regular solids , like the cube and the sphere . the pyramid , prism , cone and cylinder were not studied until the platonists . eudoxus proved the pyramid and cone have one-third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height . the equations for areas and volumes in two and three dimensions was proved by archimedes . one of archimedes ' works was called `` on the sphere and the cylinder '' . he asked that a carving of the two solid figures be placed on his tomb . he specified a `` right circular cylinder with height equal to its circumference '' because he had used this in his proof .
