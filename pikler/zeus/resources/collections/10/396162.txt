Organolithium reagent     organolithium compounds contain a direct bond between a carbon atom and a lithium atom . they are an important class of organometallic compound . the bonding between the carbon and lithium is highly polar due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms , which effectively makes the carbon negatively charged and capable of acting as a strong base or nucleophile . these compounds are similar to grignard reagents , but are much more reactive . organolithium reagents such as butyllithium are widely commercially available . due to their highly reactive nature , they must be handled under a protective atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon as they will catch fire in air .
