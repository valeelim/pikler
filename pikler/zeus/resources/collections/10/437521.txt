Gomphotherium     gomphotherium is an extinct genus of proboscid which evolved in the lower miocene of north america . it survived from 13.651.7 million years ago ( mya ) . they spread to asia , europe and africa after a drop in sea level allowed them to cross over . it survived into the pliocene , and its remains have been found in chile , china , france , germany , austria , kansas , tennessee , pakistan , kenya and bosnia and herzegovina . `` gomphotherium '' stood around high with an estimated weight of 4-5 tons , and looked similar to a modern elephant . however , it had four tusks ; two on the upper jaw and two on the long lower jaw . `` gomphotherium '' lived in dry wooded regions near lakes . the lower tusks are parallel and shaped like a shovel . they may have been used to dig up food from mud . these animals probably lived in swamps or near lakes , using their tusks to dig or scrape up aquatic vegetation . however , wear patterns on the teeth of its relative `` platybelodon '' suggest that it used its lower tusks to strip bark from trees , and may have used the sharp incisors that formed the edge of the `` shovel '' more like a modern-day scythe , grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree .
