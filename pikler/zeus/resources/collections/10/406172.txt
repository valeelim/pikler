Battle-axe     a battle-axe ( also battle axe or battle-ax ) is an axe designed for combat . battle axes were versions of utility axes . many were suitable for use in one hand , while others were larger and were used two-handed . axes designed for warfare ranged in weight from just over 0.5 kg to 3 kg ( 1 to 6 pounds ) , and in length from just over 30 cm to upwards of 1.5 m ( 1 to 5 feet ) , as in the case of the danish axe or the sparth axe . cleaving weapons longer than 1.5 m would arguably fall into the category of polearms . through the course of human history , commonplace objects have been used as weapons . axes , because they are common , are no exception . besides axes designed for combat , there were many axes that were also used as tools . axes could be modified into throwing weapons as well ( see the francisca for an example ) . axes were always cheaper than swords and were always available .
