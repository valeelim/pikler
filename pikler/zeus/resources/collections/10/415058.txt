Emulsion     putting two or more liquids together creates an emulsion if the liquids do not mix . immiscible liquids do not mix together . for example , if you add oil to water , the oil floats on the surface of the water . and if you shake the two together then leave them to stand , tiny droplets of oil float upwards . these droplets join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again . to stop the two liquids separating , we need a substance called an emulsifier . emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends : a hydrophilic end ( water-loving ) that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils , and a hydrophobic end ( water-hating ) that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water . related pages . - emulsifier
