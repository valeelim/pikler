Tipping     a tip ( also called a gratuity ) is an amount of money given as gratitude to somebody who has provided a service . it is normally in addition to any fee that is charged . it is a custom in many societies . for example , after people finish eating dinner at a restaurant , even after they have paid the bill for the food , they leave some extra money on the table to thank the server . tipping and the amount of money that people give as tips varies between countries . in some locations tipping is discouraged and considered insulting . in other locations tipping is expected from customers . the tip can be a specific range of money or a percentage of the bill , such as 15 percent or 20 percent . in some circumstances , such as with government workers in some areas , giving tips is against the law . some restaurants charge a service charge and add it onto the bill . in this case , you do not have to leave a tip . for many service workers , like servers , bartenders , and taxi drivers , tips are an important part of their income .
