Band-pass filter     a band-pass filter is an electronic filter that passes the frequency component of a signal within a certain range value , where it has its lower cutoff frequency and upper cutoff frequency . the frequency component outside that range of value will be suppressed to almost zero . in low frequency applications ( up to 100 khz ) , passive filters are generally constructed using simple r.c . networks while higher frequency filters ( above 100 khz ) are usually made from r.l , c components .
