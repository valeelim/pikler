United Empire Loyalists     united empire loyalists were people living in the 13 colonies in what was british north america in the 1770s who did not agree with the american revolution . many residents of the colonies ( possibly a majority ) either were not in complete agreement with the revolution and its leaders , or were against it . some of them actively worked against it , supporting king george iii and the british government . these people became known as `` tories '' . in many of the colonies , those who openly expressed being against the revolution and those who joined militias loyal to king george were declared to be outlaws , and their properties taken away by the people favouring the revolution . some of these people wanted to remain in a place that was still part of the british empire , so they moved to what is now canada . in many places there they received a warm welcome and became a valued part of their new home area . many of them have maintained social groups which are limited to people whose ancestors were some of these people , and they are still called `` united empire loyalists '' .
