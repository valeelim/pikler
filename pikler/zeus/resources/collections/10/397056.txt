Creatine     creatine is a combination of three non-essential amino acids , methionine , arginine and glycine . creatine is used for the production of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , which is the human body 's energy . creatine is already in the body as a natural substance . the body changes it to phosphocreatine . it is then stored as energy in the muscles . the energy systems of the body are : aerobic , lactate and phosphocreatine . creatine is mainly used in the lactate system and the phosphocreatine system because these two need more energy . they also take a part of the energy from the production or the absorption of creatine . creatine has two principals effects : bodybuilding ( or increase of muscle ) and increasing the amount of protein synthesis . the body gain is caused by the water retention of cells that store creatine . for protein synthesis , it is not entirely known , but creatine can help with the recovery of muscle . during the recovery time , the creatine gives extra energy so the cells of the muscle can speed up the protein absorption of the cells .
