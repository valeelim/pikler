Logic error     in computer programming a logic error is a bug in a program , which causes it to work incorrectly . a logic error produces unintended behaviour or output . in many cases , the syntax of the program is corrrect . this means that the environment used to make the program will not show an error . this makes logic errors difficult to find . this example function in c to calculate the average of two numbers contains a logic error . it is missing brackets in the calculation , so it compiles and runs but does not give the right answer .
