Principality of Capua     the principality of capua ( or `` '' , ) was a state in the south of the italian peninsula . it existed from the 9th century to the 11th century . for most of its history , it was independent in practice , but officially under the suzerainty of the western and eastern roman empires . capua was originally a gastaldate within the principality of benevento , and then a county within the principality of salerno . the rulers of capua were lombards until 1058 , when it was conquered by normans . old capua was an ancient etruscan city . it was the one of the most important cities in southern italy during the roman empire . when the lombards invaded italy in the second half of the 6th century , capua was sacked . later , it was made a part of the duchy of benevento , and ruled by a lombard official with the title of `` gastald '' . little is known of this part of its history . capua first became a state of its own under landulf i. in 839 , the duke of benevento , sicard , was killed by radelchis , who took the throne for himself . this caused a civil war that divided the country . sicard 's brother siconulf declared salerno independent and himself prince of salerno . landulf and his sons had also been allies to sicard , so the gastald declared capua independent too . in 841 , capua was sacked and completely destroyed by mercenaries hired by radelchis . in early 849 , landulf 's eldest son lando i asked the holy roman emperor to settle the dispute and end the war . the emperor divided benevento and salerno into two separate principalities . capua was made a county of the principality of salerno . since old capua had been destroyed , lando i had a new city built around a nearby fort in 856. this new city was the capua that still exists today .
