Grandfather paradox     the grandfather paradox is an unexplainable situation regarding time travel . it is a proposed physical paradox of time travel first described by the science fiction writer nathaniel schachner in his short story `` ancestral voices '' , and by ren√© barjavel in his 1943 book `` le voyageur imprudent '' ( `` future times three '' ) . the paradox asks what happens if you were to travel back in time and killed your grandfather . your grandfather would be dead , meaning you would never have been born , which means you could not have been alive to go back in time and kill your grandfather , but that means your grandfather would be alive and you would be born and so on with seemingly no answer . since , as far as we know , time travel of this kind is not possible , the paradox is not one we will face in practice .
