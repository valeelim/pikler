Common land     common land ( a common ) is land where local people have certain rights . for example , to allow their sheep to graze , to collect firewood , or to cut turf for fuel . originally in mediaeval england the common was part of the manor . although it was part of the estate owned by the lord of the manor , tenants had certain rights . by extension , the term `` commons '' has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to . today the term `` common '' is mainly used for the land over which the rights are exercised . a person who has a right to common land is a commoner . today commons still exist in great britain and the united states , although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed in the 17th century . related pages . - new forest
