Simplex algorithm     the simplex algorithm is an algorithm which is used to solve problems of linear programming or linear optimization . it was first used by george dantzig in 1947 , but other people like kantorovich laid the foundations in 1939. the algorithm runs in two steps : 1. first a solution to the problem is found , or the certainty that no solution exists . 1. the solution found earlier is improved , if this is possible . step 2 is run multiple times : each time , a given solution is improved , until this is no longer possible .
