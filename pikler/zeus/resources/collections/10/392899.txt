Short-term memory     short term memory is the ability to keep information in mind for a short amount time , such as remembering a phone number long enough to find a piece of paper . the mind is able to store memory that is learned recently for a small period of time for use again . the amount of time the mind is able to do this is usually within seconds . the opposite of short-term memory is long-term memory , which is where things can be stored in the mind for a long time to be recalled later . memory is what goes on in the brain in storing and retrieving past experiences . these processes do what we call remembering . memory is the foundation of intelligence and the ability to adapt from learning . information about a needle being sharp and hurtful when touched by bare hands is processed to make a response of survival and self-preservation . this leads to us ( and other animals ) to change what we do when we met needles a second time . memory , which starts out as short-term memory allows for learning , and helps intelligent behavior .
