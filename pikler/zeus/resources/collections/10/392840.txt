Fork bomb     a fork bomb is a way of stopping a computer from running by making many copies of a program . a fork bomb copies itself into more than two copies , which then copy themselves into four copies . then both the original and the copy will keep making copies until the computer can no longer handle it and crash . for example , a simple fork bomb using the bash shell script is : here , a function is defined by the name `` : `` . inside the curly braces , this function is called and its output is given again to the same function . the `` & `` is used to run the process in background . the semicolon ( `` ; `` ) marks end of the function . the last colon ( `` : `` ) calls the function for first time . after that the function keeps on calling itself until computer runs out of memory .
