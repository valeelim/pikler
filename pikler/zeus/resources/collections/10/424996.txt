Pawn shop     a pawn shop ( also called a pawnshop or pawnbroker ) is a shop or business who loans money to people who bring in valuable items which they leave with the pawnbroker . examples of items that a person may leave are jewellery , gold , watches , cameras , musical instruments , televisions or computers . the valuables that people leave are called the `` collateral '' . the person can get their valuable item back from the pawnbroker if the pay back the money they were loaned and pay interest on the loan . interest is like a fee for getting to use someone else 's money for a set time period . if the person who has borrowed money from the pawnbroker does not repay the loan and interest within an agreed-upon time limit , the pawnbroker can sell the valuable item to another customer to get back the money they loaned . to prevent thieves from using pawnshops as a way to get money from stolen goods , many communities have laws requiring that people who bring in valuable items to the pawnshop have to show identification , such as a driver 's licence .
