Marcello Malpighi     marcello malpighi ( 10 march 1628 â€“ 29 november 1694 ) was an italian doctor , who gave his name to several physiological features , like the malpighian tubule system . although the microscope was invented early in the 17th century , it was not much used until robert hooke improved the instrument . then marcello malpighi , hooke , nehemiah grew and antonie van leeuwenhoek had a virtually untried tool in their hands as they began their investigations . working on frogs and extrapolating to humans , malpighi demonstrated the structure of the lungs , previously thought to be a homogeneous mass of flesh , and he offered an explanation for how air and blood mixed in the lungs . malpighi also used the microscope for his studies of the skin , kidneys , and liver . for example , after he dissected the body of a black man , malpighi made some groundbreaking headway into the origin of black skin . he found that the black pigment was associated with a layer of mucus just beneath the skin . he was the first to see capillaries in animals , and he discovered the link between arteries and veins . he may have been the first person to see this under a microscope . the microscope let malpighi discover that the silk worm does not use lungs to breathe , but small holes in their skin called spiracles . this turned out to be true of all insects .
