Lions in heraldry     lions appear in heraldry more often than any other animal . it traditionally symbolises bravery , valour , strength , and royalty . they may appear as a charge on the shield or as a crest . they are described in the `` blazon '' ( heraldic description ) by their `` tincture '' ( color ) and `` attitude '' ( position ) . sometimes the teeth and claws of a lion can be colored differently from the rest of its body ; it is said to be `` armed '' of that color ( e.g . `` a lion or armed gules '' is a gold lion with red teeth and claws ) . sometimes the tail is even described , if it is shown in an unusual way . one reason why lions are shown in so many different ways is because when heraldry developed , a lot of people wanted a lion on their coat of arms , but no two coats of arms can be the same . the purpose of heraldry in the middle ages was to identify people with bold images over the outside of their armour . since a lot of people started putting lions on their coats of arms , they placed them in a lot of different positions and in every color used in heraldry . in france and germany , they even made patterns of colors on some of their lions , as if they were painted .
