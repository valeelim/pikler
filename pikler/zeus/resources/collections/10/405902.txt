Holomorphic function     in mathematics a holomorphic function is a function that is defined on the complex numbers , and that can be differentiated everywhere where it is defined . differentiating the function again leads to a function defined on the complex numbers . in older literature , these functions are sometimes called `` regular '' . holomorphic functions show a number of properties function defined on real numbers do not have .
