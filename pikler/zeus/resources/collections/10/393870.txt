Ancient Greek sculpture     ancient greek sculpture is the sculpture of ancient greece . there are three major stages . sculpture was used to show the battles , mythology , and rulers of the area known as ancient greece . the greeks began again to carve in stone as they came out of their dark age . they were inspired by the large stone sculptures of mesopotamia and egypt . free-standing figures share the solidity and front-facing stance of their eastern models . however , their style is more dynamic than those of egyptian sculpture . this is clear in the `` lady of auxerre '' and the `` torso of hera '' ( early archaic period , c. 660–580 bc . both are in the louvre , paris ) . after about 575 bc , figures such as these , both male and female , began wearing the so-called 'archaic smile ' . this may have been a device to give the figures a distinctive human appearance . three types of figures are common – the standing nude youth ( `` kouros '' , plural `` kouroi '' ) , the standing draped girl ( `` kore '' , plural `` korai '' ) , and the seated woman . all emphasize and generalize the essential features of the human figure and show an increasingly accurate understanding of human anatomy .
