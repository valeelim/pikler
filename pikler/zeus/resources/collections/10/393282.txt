Annual percentage rate     the term annual percentage rate ( apr ) , also called nominal apr , and the term effective apr , means the interest rate for a whole year , rather than just a monthly fee/rate , as applied on a loan , mortgage loan , or credit card . this rate is useful when buying a car , a house , or any other expensive possession . since few people are able to afford to pay the full price , many sellers choose to divide the price into monthly payments and a down payment . this makes things easier to buy . once the buyer pays the down payment , he or she enters into an agreement to pay the remaining months . but since the buyer has not paid the entire amount yet , the seller is essentially lending part of the purchase to the buyer . this is where interest rates come in . the seller charges the monthly payments with a part or a percentage of the remaining amount . this amount gets added onto the monthly payment . some companies force the buyer to pay the interest first , and the remaining amount pays the original loaned amount , called the principal .
