Arius     arius ( born around 260 , died 336 in constantinople ) was an early christian thinker . he lived in alexandria , but was probably born in libya . he did not agree with his bishop alexander who said that jesus and god were the same . arius said jesus and god were not the same since there was a time when jesus did not exist . at the first council of nicea , most bishops did not vote with arius ; the official document says that god the father and jesus the son were of the same essence , and therefore the same being . they voted that jesus and god had existed together for all time .
