Beautiful Dreamer     `` beautiful dreamer '' is a song by stephen foster written about 1862. it was first published ( posthumously ) in 1864 by william a. pond & co. it has been promoted as foster 's last song , but that distinction can not be confirmed . it is similar in some respects to his first published song , `` open they lattice , love '' . both have a triple rhythm and share imagery of the sea and marine life . the arpeggiated accompaniment recalls bel canto opera . the dreamer in this song is either asleep or dead . the song does not distinguish . it is a song though about dissolution of melting , of dissolving , of vanishing into mists , and , finally into death . the song is not held in the highest esteem by some musicologists and has been described by one as `` saccharine '' and `` [ smacking ] somewhat of the idiom of irving berlin . '' < poem > 1. beautiful dreamer , wake unto me , starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee ; sounds of the rude world , heard in the day , lull 'd by the moonlight have all pass 'd away !
