Fishplate     in rail terminology , a fishplate , splice bar or joint bar is a metal bar that is bolted to the ends of two rails to join them together in a track . the name is derived from `` fish '' , a wooden bar with a curved profile used to strengthen a ship 's mast . the top and bottom edges are tapered inwards so the device wedges itself between the top and bottom of the rail when it is bolted into place . in rail transport modelling , a fishplate is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity .
