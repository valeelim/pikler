Saint Helena plover     the saint helena plover ( `` charadrius sanctaehelenae '' ) , locally known as the wirebird , is a small bird ( a plover ) endemic to the island of saint helena . the bird was first mentioned in 1638 , and is the national bird of saint helena ; it appears on the top half of the island 's coat of arms . some older coins of saint helena ( before 1998 ) have the wirebird on its reverse . the saint helena plover is the only bird species endemic to the south atlantic island of saint helena that is still living . it is a small bird ( length : 15 cm ) with long and thin legs , like wires ; because of that , the bird is known as `` wirebird '' in saint helena . kittlitz 's plover ( `` charadrius pecuarius '' ) is the saint helena bird 's closest relative ; for some authors , the saint helena plover is a subspecies of the kittlitz 's plover but most zoologists think that they are two different species . the saint helena plover spends most of its time on the ground and does not fly frequently ; it is most commonly found in pairs , or sometimes in small groups of young birds , looking for food ( snails , beetles and other invertebrates ) in grassland o in semi-desert areas .
