Sit-ski     a sit-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia , spina bifida , muscular dystrophy , or cerebral palsy . it is made from fiberglass . early sit-skis looked like kayaks and had metal edges . sit-skis are used for para-nordic skiing and para-alpine skiing . if the sit-ski has one ski , it is sometimes name a mono-ski . if a sit-ski has two skis , it is sometimes called a bi-ski . skiers first used bi-skis in para-alpine skiing before using mono-skis . mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill . sit-ski users use outrigger skis . in para-nordic skiing , a sit-skier may use a normal ski pole that is not as long as one people standing up to ski would use . when skiers first learn to ski , their teacher may be connected to them on a tether until the skier can control the sit-ski on their own .
