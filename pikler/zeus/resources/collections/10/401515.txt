Cellular automaton     a cellular automaton is a model used in computer science and mathematics . the idea is to model a dynamic system by using a number of cells . each cell has one of several possible states . with each `` turn '' or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things : its current state , and the states of the neighbouring cells . a very famous example of a cellular automata is conway 's game of life . stanislaw ulam and john von neumann first described cellular automata in the 1940s . conway 's game of life was first shown in the 1970s . some biological processes occur—or can be simulated—by cellular automata . the patterns of certain seashells are generated by natural cellular automata . examples can be seen in the genera `` conus '' and `` cymbiola '' . the pigment cells are in a narrow band along the shell 's lip . each cell secretes pigments according to the activating and inhibiting activity of its neighbor pigment cells , obeying a natural version of a mathematical rule . the cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it grows slowly . for example , the widespread species `` conus textile '' bears a pattern resembling wolfram 's rule 30 cellular automaton .
