Euler characteristic     the euler characteristic of a shape is a number that describes a topological space , so that anything in the space will have the same number . it is calculated by taking the number of points in the shape , the number of lines in the shape , and the number of faces of the shape . then , you find the euler characteristic with this formula : v is the point count , e the line count , and f the amount of faces . for most common shapes , the euler characteristic is 2 .
