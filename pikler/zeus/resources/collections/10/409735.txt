Historical novel     according to encyclopædia britannica , a historical novel is many regard sir walter scott as the first to write historical novels . györgy lukács , in his `` the historical novel '' , argues that scott is the first fiction writer who saw history not just as a convenient frame in which to stage a contemporary narrative , but rather as a distinct social and cultural setting . his novels of scottish history such as `` waverley '' ( 1814 ) and `` rob roy '' ( 1817 ) focus upon a middling character who sits at the intersection of various social groups in order to explore the development of society through conflict . his `` ivanhoe '' ( 1820 ) gains credit for renewing interest in the middle ages . victor hugo 's `` the hunchback of notre dame '' ( 1831 ) furnishes another 19th-century example of the romantic-historical novel as does leo tolstoy 's `` war and peace '' . in the united states , james fenimore cooper was a prominent author of historical novels . in french literature , the most prominent inheritor of scott 's style of the historical novel was balzac .
