Geological map     a geological or geologic map is a special-purpose map made to show geological features . william smith was the man who first did the geological map of england . rock units or strata are shown by colour or symbols which show where they are exposed at the surface . threee-dimensional features like faults , folds , with symbols which give these features ' orientations . stratigraphic contour lines may be used to illustrate the surface of a selected strata illustrating the subsurface topographic trends of the strata . isopach maps detail the variations in thickness of stratigraphic units . it is not always possible to show this properly : the strata may be extremely fractured , mixed , or otherwise disturbed . there are often gaps ( discontinuities ) where erosion has removed strata .
