Palisades Sill     the palisades sill is a triassic intrusion , formed 200 million years ago . it runs through parts of new york and new jersey . it is noteworthy for the palisades , cliffs which rise steeply above the western bank of the hudson river . the visibility of the sill , and its unique features , have got much attention from nature enthusiasts , rock climbers , and geologists . the outcrop of the palisades sill is quite recognizable for its prominent cliffs above the hudson river ; it is easily seen from the western portions of manhattan . the exposure is approximately long , most of it following the hudson river . it first emerges in staten island in new york city . the sill then crosses the state line into new jersey , where hoboken , jersey city , union city , fort lee , and englewood cliffs all lie on it . the end of the triassic saw large-scale rifting during the break-up of pangaea . what is now eastern north america began to separate from what is now north-western africa , creating the young atlantic ocean . magma came from decompression melting , and some was pushed into the pre-existing sandstones and arkoses . the magma solidified and , after millions of years , the overlying rocks got uplifted and eroded , exposing the palisades sill as we see it .
