Sandpiper     sandpipers are a large family of waders or shorebirds , the scolopacidae . they include many species called sandpipers , as well as those called by names such as curlew and snipe . most species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil . different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat on the coast without direct competition for food . sandpipers have long bodies and legs , and narrow wings . most species have a narrow bill , but otherwise the form and length are quite variable . they are small to medium sized birds , measuring cm in length . the bills are sensitive , allowing the birds to feel the mud and sand as they probe for food . they generally have dull plumage , with cryptic brown , grey , or streaked patterns , although some display brighter colours during the breeding season . most species nest in open areas , and defend their territories with aerial displays . the nest itself is a simple scrape in the ground , in which the bird usually lays three or four eggs . the young of most species are precocial .
