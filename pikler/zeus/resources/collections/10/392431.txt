Horn clause     a horn clause is a logic disjunction of literals , where at most one of the literals is positive , and all the others are negative . it is named after alfred horn who described them in an article in 1951. a horn clause with exactly one positive literal is a definite clause ; a definite clause with no negative literals is sometimes called a “ fact ” ; and a horn clause without a positive literal is sometimes called a goal clause . these three kinds of horn clauses are illustrated in the following propositional example : in the non-propositional case , all variables in a clause are implicitly universally quantified with scope the entire clause . thus , for example : stands for : which is logically equivalent to : horn clauses play a basic role in constructive logic and computational logic . they are important in automated theorem proving by first-order resolution , because the resolvent of two horn clauses is itself a horn clause , and the resolvent of a goal clause and a definite clause is a goal clause . these properties of horn clauses can lead to greater efficiencies in proving a theorem ( represented as the negation of a goal clause ) .
