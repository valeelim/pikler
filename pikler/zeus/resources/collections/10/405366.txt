Tuber     tuber is the thickened part of an underground stem of a plant , such as the potato , with buds from which new plant shoots ( stems and young leaves of a new plant ) grow . most tubers are formed in the ground , but sometimes they can be formed above the ground , in the aerial stems ; that is the case of the air potato ( `` dioscorea bulbifera '' ) . tubers stems ( or part of stems ) are made bigger to store nutrients . starch ( formed by a lot of glucose molecules ) is the most commonly stored food in the tubers , although other carbohydrates , such as inuline ( formed by many fructose molecules ) , are stored in the tubers of certain kinds of plants , like the jerusalem artichoke ( `` helianthus tuberosus '' ) . the purpose of tubers are saving food and reproduction . under natural conditions , the parts of the stem that connect the tubers with the main stem die in the autumn or winter . the tubers are left in the ground and are able to produce shoots from their buds the following spring . potatoes are also artificially reproduced by tuber pieces , called `` seed pieces '' . a tuber is cut into pieces , each with one or more `` eyes '' ( an `` eye '' of potato is a group of buds covered by very small leaves ) . these pieces are planted and each produces a new plant from one of its `` eyes '' .
