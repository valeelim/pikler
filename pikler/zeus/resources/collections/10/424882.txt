Lap dance     a lap dance is a type of sex work performed in some strip clubs ( clubs in which women or men take off their clothes as they dance to music ) . in this , a dancer performs an erotic dance either contacting their body ( contact dancing ) with a seated patron or within a very short distance of a seated patron . the dancer may be naked , topless or wearing a bikini top and bottom , depending on the laws in the jurisdiction of the strip club and the club 's policies . with full-contact lap dances , the stripper may engage in contact with the patron , such as pressing his or her body against the patron . different types include a `` couch dance '' , which is a lap dance where the customer is seated on a couch , and bed dance where the customer lies down on a bed . in some clubs , a `` block session '' of lap dances ( usually half an hour to an hour ) can be booked in a `` champagne room '' , which is a private room in the back of a club . in many clubs , the duration of a lap dance is measured by the length of the song being played by the club 's dj . charges for lap dances vary .
