Understanding Media     understanding media : the extensions of man is a 1964 book by marshall mcluhan . it was a pioneering study in media theory . mccluhan was a professor of literature who was deeply interested in the way media had changed society . the book proposes that media themselves affect their content in important ways . it is an attempt to understand how changing media have affected society . mcluhan suggests that media play a role , not by the content delivered , but by the characteristics of the medium itself . mcluhan pointed to the light bulb as an example . a light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs , but it is a medium that has a social effect . the light bulb lets people do things at nighttime which would be impossible in darkness . he describes the light bulb as a medium without any content . mcluhan states that `` a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence '' . more controversially , he thought that content had little effect on society — for example , it did not matter if television broadcasts children 's shows or violent programming — the effect of television on society would be identical . he noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways ; for instance , a passage in a book could be reread at will , but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it . he made the point that reading , by its very nature , is a sequential medium . one reads it in a sequence . on the other hand , a medium like film presents information more holistically . there is a kind of `` all at once-ness '' about films and television .
