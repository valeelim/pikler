Tom Lehrer     tom lehrer ( born 9 april 1928 ) , also known as thomas andrew lehrer , is an american singer-songwriter , pianist and mathematician . lehrer is known for his very funny songs which were written in the 1950s and 1960s . many people consider him a genius because of the hilarious lyrics in his songs . he is known for songs such as pollution and notably `` the elements '' which is a list of the chemical elements that are , as he says , `` set to a possibly recognizable tune , '' which is , in this case , the `` major-general 's song '' . there has been a heated debate between tom lehrer fans and georg kreisler fans about who wrote which song first ? kreisler wrote `` die hand '' which had many features that were the same with `` i hold your hand in mine '' which was written by lehrer . another song was `` taubenvergiften im park '' which is also very similar to `` poisoning pigeons in the park '' by lehrer . this debate has gone for years , and because both had denied from copying each other 's idea , it can not be decided if kreisler wrote it first or lehrer . according to lehrer himself , he said it was not fair that kreisler gets to get a recording before he gets to do his . despite this being vital evidence against him , he claims that he done this song long before the recording was made in concerts around america .
