Cross-Strait relations     cross-strait relations ( ) is the relations between the governments of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) and the republic of china ( roc ) . neither government recognises one another . both officially use the one-china policy . under this policy , there is only one legitimate government of china . both the prc and the roc claim to be that government . cross-strait relations are not international relations , where matters are handled by the ministry of foreign affairs . this is because both governments claim that each other 's territory is part of their country . however , the relations are not purely domestic relations either . any interaction by the prc 's government with taiwan is done by the association of relations across the taiwan strait ( arats ) . this is under the taiwan affairs office of the prc . any interaction by the roc 's government with mainland china is done by strait exchange foundation ( sef ) under the mainland affairs council of the roc . the prc 's view is that taiwan is part of prc under the `` one country , two systems '' ( ) policy . this policy was introduced by deng xiaoping in 1984. the roc 's view is that mainland china is part of the roc under the `` 'one country , two areas '' ( ) policy . this policy was introduced by wu po-hsiung in 2012 .
