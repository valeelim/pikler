Vellum     vellum is a high-quality form of parchment . originally , it meant calf skin , but in english the term is used more widely . like parchment , the skin is prepared to take writing in ink . it was one of the standard writing surfaces used in europe before paper became available . it continued to be used for high-status documents . the vellum was used for single pages , scrolls , codices or books . to manufacture vellum , the skin is cleaned , then bleached , stretched on a frame called a `` herse '' , and scraped with a knife . when vellum is scraped , it is by turns wet and dry to create tension . a final finish is got by rubbing the surface with pumice , and treating it with lime or chalk . then it is ready to accept ink . modern `` paper vellum '' ( sometimes called vegetable vellum ) is made out of synthetic material instead of mammal skin , but is used for the same purpose as normal vellum . in ancient europe , vellum meant good quality prepared animal skin . calves , sheep , goat and even camel are known to have been used to make vellum . the very best vellum was made from unborn animals . it can be hard to identify the animal used to make old vellum without using a science lab .
