NuSTAR     nustar is a telescope launched into space by nasa in 2012. it is the eleventh satellite in the `` small explorer '' program . telescopes in space can see much better than on earth , because the telescopes on earth need to look through the atmosphere . nustar measures high-energy x-rays , which have a much higher frequency than visible light . it uses special optical devices to do this , so it works differently from a normal telescope . this type of telescope is called a wolter telescope . nustar is searching for black holes . it is also looking at supernovae to help understand how the chemical elements are created . one of the first discoveries made by nustar , along with another space telescope called xmm-newton , was to measure the spin rate of a supermassive black hole for the first time . further reading . - nustar website at nasa .
