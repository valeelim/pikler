Alternator     an alternator is a generator which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current . there is one in every car . most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature . the armature reacts to the rotating field and carries the current caused by the rotation . in principle , any ac electrical generator can be called an alternator , but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines . an alternator that uses a permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto . alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo-alternators . alternating current generating systems were known from the discovery of the magnetic induction of electric current . the early machines were developed by pioneers such as michael faraday and hippolyte pixii .
