Women in Ancient Greece     the status of women in ancient greece varied form city state to city state . women in ancient delphi , gortyn , thessaly , megara and sparta could own land , which was the most prestigious form of private property at the time . in ancient athens , women were not citizens . until marriage , women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative . after marriage , their husband ( `` kyrios '' ) acted for the wife in all legal matters . athenian women had limited property rights . athenian women could enter into a contract worth less than the value of a “ medimnos of barley ” ( a measure of grain ) . this allowed women to engage in petty trading . slaves , like free women , were not eligible for full citizenship in ancient athens , but sometimes , rarely , they could become citizens if freed . women , on the other hand , could never get full civil rights . no women ever acquired citizenship in ancient athens , and so they were excluded from ancient athenian democracy . by contrast , spartan women enjoyed a status , power , and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world . although spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of spartan warriors . as men engaged in military activity , women took responsibility for running estates .
