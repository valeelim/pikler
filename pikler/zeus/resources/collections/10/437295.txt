Revolver     the term revolver refers to repeating firearms with a revolving cylinder . revolvers have several chambers . these are handguns although other types of weapons use revolving cylinders . they are also called revolving guns , though `` revolver '' is used far more often . the first revolvers date back to late 1500s in europe . it was not until the 1700s or 1800s , however , they became affordable . revolvers are sometimes used by law enforcement agencies . on some occasions , these guns can be reset by one hand , then loaded with the other . in a single-action revolver , the hammer is manually cocked . this is usually done with the thumb . this action advances the cylinder to the next cartridge . it also locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel . the trigger , when pulled , releases the hammer , which fires the round in the chamber . to fire again , the hammer must be manually cocked again . this is called `` single-action '' because the trigger only performs a single actionâ€”that of releasing the hammer . because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is very light , firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy . additionally , the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety . the gun will not fire unless the hammer is cocked back . the colt paterson revolver , the walker colt , the colt 's dragoon and the colt single action army pistol of the american frontier era are all good examples of this system .
