Bipolar junction transistor     a bipolar junction transistor ( bjt or bipolar transistor ) is a type of transistor that relies on the contact of two types of semiconductor in order for it to work . bjts can be used as amplifiers , switches , or in oscillators . bjts can be found either on their own , or in large numbers as parts of integrated circuits . they are named `` bipolar '' transistors because their operation involves both electrons and holes . the current gained is measured in h , forward current gain . typical amount can be between 200-350. other websites . - simulation of a bjt in the common emitter circuit
