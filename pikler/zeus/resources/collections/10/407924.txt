Geology of Connecticut     connecticut is a us state . it is in the north-eastern side of the country . as part of the new england region , connecticut has undergone much geologic change . it has been shaped by plate tectonics , volcanism , and glacial activity . during the early triassic era , the super-continent pangea was formed as the iapetus ocean closed up and the proto-north american continent collided with avalonia ( modern day africa ) . this caused great uplift and the creation of the appalachian mountains . erosion of the appalachian mountains now exposes metamorphic rocks once very deep in the earth 's mantle and uplifted during this time period . about 200 million years after this collision and the formation of pangea , during the middle of the mesozoic era , the atlantic ocean floor started spreading . this caused a lot of stress . this caused a geologic fault . connecticut 's famous eastern border fault was created . as a result , the land west of this fault was downset , creating a rift valley and causing the land to tilt an average of 15 to 25 degrees . the fault is currently inactive . the formation of this basin eventually refilled with soft fluvial and alluvial sediments .
