Gravitational field     in physics , a gravitational field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body has . the influence extends into the space around itself , producing a force on another massive body . thus , a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena ( effects ) . it is measured in newtons per kilogram ( n/kg ) . in the original newtonian concept , gravity was a force between point masses . following newton , laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid . since the 19th century explanations for gravity have in terms of a field model , rather than a point attraction . this revolution was brought about by einstein 's general theory of relativity . most scientists believe that the gravitational field and its gravitational waves are the physical interpretations of einstein 's equations of general relativity . in a field model , rather than two particles attracting each other , the mass of objects distort spacetime . this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a `` force '' . in such a model matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime . one can say either `` there is no gravitational force '' , or that `` gravity is a fictitious force '' .
