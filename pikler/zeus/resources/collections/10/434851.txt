Glial cell     glial cells are support cells for the nervous system . in greek , glia means `` glue '' . glia are said to be the glue of the nervous system . glia occur in both grey matter and white matter . glia are thought to have four main functions : 1. to surround neurons and hold them in place , 1. to supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons , 1. to insulate one neuron from another , 1. to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons . glia may have more functions than just these four . a type of glial cell are thought to play a role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als or motor neurone disease ) , alzheimer 's disease ( a type of dementia ) and parkinson 's disease . the microglia are the macrophages of the nervous system . in these neurodegenerative disorders , it 's thought that the microglia digest healthy brain cells , causing the degeneration of brain function . this is especially true for parkinson 's disease , where the glia break down dopaminergic cells , causing the symptoms associated with parkinson 's .
