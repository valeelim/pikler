Oil sands     oil sands , or tar sands are an unconventional source of petroleum . the oil sands are a mixture of sand , clay and water together with a dense and extremely sticky form of petroleum referred to as bitumen . natural bitumen is found in many countries , with the largest quantities in canada , kazakhstan and russia . the estimated worldwide deposits are more than 2 trillion barrels ( 320 billion cubic metres ) . these estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered . around 70 % of all proven reserves are in canada . oil produced from bitumen sands is often referred to as unconventional oil , to separate it from traditional liquid oil . the production process is very energy consuming so that the net energy gain is much smaller compared to traditional oil . making liquid fuels from oil sands requires much energy and produces 12 percent more greenhouse gases per barrel of final product than production of traditional oil . therefore oil sands have only recently been considered to be part of the world 's oil reserves . higher oil prices now allow for profitable extraction and processing .
