Fourier analysis     fourier analysis is a branch of analysis that looks at how more complex functions can be built with simpler ones . it is also known as classical harmonic analysis . it is named after joseph fourier who first used it in the 19th century . the process itself is called fourier transform . fourier analysis is widely used in fields such as physics , partial differential equations , number theory , combinatorics , signal processing , imaging , probability theory , statistics , option pricing , cryptography , numerical analysis , acoustics , oceanography , sonar , optics , diffraction , geometry and protein structure analysis .
