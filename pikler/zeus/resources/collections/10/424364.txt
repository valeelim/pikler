Listening     listening is not quite the same thing as hearing . hearing is a biological process that can be scientifically explained , but listening is a psychological process of what happens to sounds as we interpret and use them . it is a cognitive activity . in psychology , speech is part of pragmatics , a field which deals with signs and their interpretation . the signs in question are called `` speech acts '' . to listen means to try and understand what has been said . listening is often one side of a conversation . asking questions helps one understand what has been said . a subject can be better understood by asking the correct questions . listening differs from obeying . parents often say to a disobedient child that he `` did n't listen to me '' , meaning , he heard but did n't do as was suggested . listening also applies to sounds , not just language . it is `` active '' hearing . we hear a sound , and know what it means . this applies to animals as well . cats list in the long grass for the little sounds that mice make . so perhaps a better description of listening is `` deliberate hearing to get the meaning of sounds '' .
