Óðr    óðr in norse mythology , óðr ( sometimes written in english as odr or od ) is a man associated with the goddess freyja . the `` prose edda '' and `` heimskringla '' , both by snorri sturluson , describe óðr as freyja 's husband . they also describe him as the father of freyja 's daughter hnoss . `` heimskringla '' adds that the couple had another daughter together , gersemi . not much else is written about óðr , except that he often went away on long journeys . freyja wept when she missed him . several scholars have suggested that óðr may just have been another name for the god odin .
