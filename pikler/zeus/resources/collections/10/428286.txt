Excitation (magnetic)    excitation ( magnetic ) excitation is a process to create a magnetic field from electric current . this process is used in electric machines ( generators or motors ) whose rotor spins in a magnetic field . this magnetic field can come from a permanent magnet or field coils . in the case of electric machine with field coils , a current must flow to the coil to generate the magnetic field , so that the field coils can act as a `` magnet '' , like in the case of electric machine with permanent magnet . the device in which excitation happens is called the exciter .
