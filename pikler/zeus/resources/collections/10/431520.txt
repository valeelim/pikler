Ornithomimidae     ornithomimidae ( `` bird-mimics '' ) is a group of theropod dinosaurs which bore a superficial resemblance to modern ostriches . they were fast , omnivorous or herbivorous dinosaurs from the upper cretaceous of laurasia ( now asia and north america ) . members of the ornithomimidae include `` gallimimus '' , `` archaeornithomimus '' , `` anserimimus '' , `` struthiomimus '' , and `` ornithomimus '' . ornithomimids are a sister group to the troodontids . these groups had many bird-like features , including feathers , but they were not birds . the skulls of ornithomimids were small , with large eyes , above relatively long and slender necks . all had toothless beaks . the fore limbs ( 'arms ' ) were long and slender and bore powerful claws . the hind limbs were long and powerful , with a long foot and short , strong toes terminating in hooflike claws . ornithomimids probably acquired most of their calories from plants . many ornithomimosaurs , including primitive species , have been found with numerous gastroliths in their stomachs , characteristic of herbivores . henry fairfield osborn suggested that the long , sloth-like 'arms ' of ornithomimids may have been used to pull down branches on which to feed , an idea supported by further study of their strange , hook-like hands . ornithomimids probably acquired most of their calories from plants . many ornithomimosaurs , including primitive species , have been found with numerous gastroliths in their stomachs , characteristic of herbivores .
