NGC 1569     ngc 1569 is a dwarf irregular galaxy in camelopardalis . this faint galaxy is well studied by professional astronomers , who are interested in the history of star formation in the galaxy . the galaxy is relatively nearby , so the hubble space telescope can easily pick out its stars . in 2008 scientists studying images from hubble calculated the galaxy 's distance at nearly 11 million light-years away , making it a member of the ic 342 group of galaxies . the most notable feature of ngc 1569 is its powerful starburst . it has formed stars at a rate 100 times greater than that of our galaxy during the last 100 million years . it contains two prominent super star clusters with different histories . super star cluster a , in the northwest of the galaxy is formed of two close clusters ( `` ngc 1569 a1 '' and `` ngc 1569 a2 '' ) . it contains young stars ( including wolfrayet stars ) which formed less than 5 million years ago ( in `` ngc 1569 a1 '' ) as well as older red stars ( in `` ngc 1569 a2 '' ) . super star cluster b , near the center of the galaxy , has older red giants and red supergiants .
