Multi-instrumentalist     a multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments . many professional musicians aim to become multi-instrumentalists . in an orchestra , a number of musicians might each play a variety of different instruments during a single performance . orchestras will also often , but not always , ask for several members of the woodwind section to be multi-instrumentalists . this is sometimes referred to as doubling . typically , for example , one flute player in the orchestra will switch to playing the piccolo or alto flute when called to by the score . if an orchestra is playing a piece that needs `` two flutes and a third flute doubling piccolo '' , it means that the third flautist also has a piccolo . sometimes he or she will need to put the flute down and play the piccolo , then perhaps swap round again . an oboist may sometimes double on the cor anglais , a clarinettist may sometimes double on a bass clarinet , and a bassoonist may double on a contrabassoon . at other times such instruments may need a separate player . at the beginning of a musical score there should be a list of instruments that makes it clear how many players are needed .
