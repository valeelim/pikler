HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee     the hugo gene nomenclature committee ( hgnc ) sets a `` unique '' and `` meaningful '' name for every known human gene . it asks experts their opinions . the hgnc gives a long name , and an abbreviation ( referred to as a `` symbol '' ) to every gene . the hgnc is part of the human genome organisation ( hugo ) . traditional gene names and abbreviations are often not specific for a single gene . example : cap ( which means just `` chromosome-associated protein '' ) can refer to any of six different genes : ( brd4 , cap1 , lnpep , ptpla , serpinb6 , and sorbs1 ) . unlike traditional names like cap , the hgnc short gene names , or gene symbols , are given to one gene only . this reduces confusion as to which gene is referred to . the hgnc approach to naming genes and assigning `` symbols '' ( gene name abbreviations ) is : 1 . `` gene symbols must be unique '' 1. symbols should only use the roman alphabet and arabic numerals 1. symbols should not contain punctuation or `` g '' for gene 1. symbols do not contain any reference to the species they are encoded in , i.e . `` h/h '' for human
