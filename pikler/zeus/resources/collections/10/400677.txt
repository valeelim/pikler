Siderian     the siderian is the first geological period in the palaeoproterozoic that began 2.5 billion years ago , and ended at 2.3 billion years ago . before it was the neoarchaean it is followed by the rhyacian . banded iron formations ( bifs ) became very abundant early this period . bifs were formed as anaerobic algae produced waste oxygen that combined with iron , forming magnetite ( feo , an iron oxide ) . this process cleared iron from the oceans , presumably turning greenish seas clear . eventually , without an oxygen sink in the oceans , the process created the oxygen-rich atmosphere of today . this event is known as the oxygen catastrophe , which according to some geologists triggered the huronian glaciation . the huronian glaciation took place in the siderian between 2400 mya and 2300 mya .
