Gaia (spacecraft)    gaia ( spacecraft ) gaia is a space observatory . it was launched by the european space agency ( esa ) on 19 december 2013. the mission aims to compile a 3d space catalogue of about one billion astronomical objects . it will study about 1 % of the milky way population . a successor to the `` hipparcos '' mission , it is part of esa 's horizon 2000 plus long-term scientific program . gaia will monitor each of its target stars about 70 times over a period of five years . gaia will create an extremely precise three-dimensional map of stars throughout the milky way galaxy and map their motions . this data is a product of the origin and subsequent evolution of the milky way . the spectroscopic measurements will find the physical properties of each star observed , their luminosity , temperature , gravity and elemental composition . the massive stellar census will provide the basic observational data . with the data , astronomers hope to tackle a range of important problems , like the origin , structure , and evolutionary history of our galaxy . large numbers of quasars , galaxies , extrasolar planets and solar system bodies will be measured at the same time .
