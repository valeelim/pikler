Protocol 41     protocol 41 is a communication protocol which embeds internet protocol version 6 ( ipv6 ) packets inside internet protocol version 4 ( ipv4 ) packets . it is usually used to allow a computer or router with only an ipv4 address to obtain an ipv6 address ( or possibly more than one address , to serve multiple computers ) . most ipv6 tunnel providers support protocol 41 , including hurricane electric and sixxs . 6to4 , 6rd , and 6in4 are all different methods of using protocol 41. protocol 41 does not use tcp or udp ( although the ipv6 packets inside can carry tcp and udp traffic ) . is not to be confused with tcp or udp port number 41 . 6to4 is a special usage of protocol 41. a 6to4 address starts with the digits 2002 , followed by the ipv4 address of its router . a 6to4 address might look like : 2002 : cb00:71ff:0 : fe64:3486 : d398:3346 related pages . - teredo tunneling
