Grey matter     grey matter ( or gray matter ) is a main component of the central nervous system . it is composed of neurons ( that is , the cells usually called 'brain cells ' ) and glial cells . by contrast , the white matter is composed of long-range myelinated axon tracts ( nerve fibres ) and glial cells . the colour difference arises mainly from the whiteness of myelin . in living tissue , grey matter actually has a very light grey colour with yellowish or pinkish hues , which come from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies .
