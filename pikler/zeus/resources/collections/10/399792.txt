Navi Mumbai     navi mumbai is a planned satellite city of mumbai , on the west coast of maharashtra in india . it was developed in 1972 as a new urban township of mumbai , and is currently the largest planned city in the world . navi mumbai , located in the eastern harbour of mumbai , is one of the world 's largest planned townships . since independence , there was a specific reason to build a new city on the mainland across the harbour : to lower the population of mumbai , an island city whose physical expansion had a limit . it was regarded as an alternative for the many people who wanted to come to mumbai from all over india . this decision required the maharashtra government to relocate its seat of governance along with all its important offices to this new city , and completely stop the backbay reclamation project in the island city . it did not do this . it continued with the reclamation and put brakes on the efforts of cidco ( such as the shifting of wholesale markets ) . the planning of navi mumbai did not fully begin until 1971. south navi mumbai is being quickly developed with modern infrastructure in parts of kharghar , kamothe , new panvel and kalamboli .
