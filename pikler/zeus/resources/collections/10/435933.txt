Bed (geology)    bed ( geology ) in geology a bed is the smallest division of rock or deposit . it is a geologic formation or stratigraphic rock series marked by well-defined divisional planes ( bedding planes ) separating it from layers above and below . a bed is the smallest lithostratigraphic unit . it ranges in thickness from a centimetre to several metres . it can be distinguished from beds above and below it by rock or mineral type and particle size . the term is usually applied to sedimentary strata , but may also be used for volcanic flows or ash layers . in a quarry , bedding is a term used for a structure occurring in granite and similar rocks which allows them to split in well-defined planes horizontally or parallel to the land surface . in geotechnical engineering a bedding plane often forms a discontinuity that may have a large influence on the mechanical behaviour ( strength , deformation ) of soil and rock masses . this is important in , for example , tunnel , foundation , or slope construction . related pages .
