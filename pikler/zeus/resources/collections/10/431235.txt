Dwarf star     dwarf stars refers to several types of star . the term was originally used in 1906 by the danish astronomer ejnar hertzsprung . he noticed that the reddest stars—classified as k and m in the harvard scheme—could be divided into two distinct groups . they are either much brighter than the sun , or much fainter . to distinguish these groups , he called them `` giant '' and `` dwarf '' stars . the dwarf stars were fainter and the giants brighter than the sun . however , the term `` dwarf '' was later expanded to include : - `` dwarf star '' : this usually refers to any main-sequence star , a star of luminosity class v. - `` red dwarfs '' are low-mass main-sequence stars . - `` yellow dwarfs '' are main-sequence ( dwarf ) stars with masses similar to the sun . - a `` white dwarf '' is a star composed of electron-degenerate matter . this may be the final stage in the evolution of stars not massive enough to collapse into a neutron star or undergo a type ii supernova—stars less massive than about 9 solar masses . - a `` black dwarf '' is a white dwarf which has cooled enough that it no longer emits any visible light .
