Iberian Union     the iberian union was a state that governed the iberian penisula between 1580 and 1640. after the war of the portuguese succession , the monarchies of portugal and the spanish brach of the house of habsburg were linked . a dynastic union joined the crowns of castile , portugal and aragon along with their respective colonial possessions , under the rule of the hispanic monarchy . the habsburg king was the only element of connection between the kingdoms and territories . the institutions , government and legal traditions of each kingdom remained independent of each other . the alien laws ( leyes de extranjeria ) determined that the national of one kingdom was a foreigner in all the other iberian kingdoms . the term `` iberian union '' was not used at the time , it is a creation of modern historians . the monarchs had long wanted to unify the penisula : they had the visigothic monarchy in mind . sancho iii of navarre and alfonso vii of león and castile both took the title `` imperator totius hispaniae '' , meaning `` emperor of all hispania '' centuries before . if miguel da paz ( 1498–1500 ) , prince of portugal and asturias had become king , the union could have been achieved earlier . unfortunately , he died early in his childhood .
