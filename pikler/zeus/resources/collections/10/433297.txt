Black operation     a black operation ( black op for short ) is a covert operation which is done by a government or military . black operations are secret and whoever does them does not admit that they ever happened . there are differences between black operations and ones which are just secret . the main difference is that a black operation often uses deception . this deception might be not telling anybody who did the operation . it might also be blaming the operation on someone else ( `` false flag '' operations ) . one example of a black operation is a `` black bag operation '' . a black bag operation is when agents or soldiers secretly go into buildings and collect intelligence . it is known that the federal bureau of investigation , the central intelligence agency , mossad , mi6 and other intelligence services have done operations like these . the word `` black '' can be used for any secret action done by a government . for example , some militaries and intelligence services have classified `` black budgets '' to carry out black operations . almost all details about this budget is hidden from the public .
