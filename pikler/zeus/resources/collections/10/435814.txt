Chr     in computing , chr is a type of file format commonly used for graphics ( i.e . 3d max characters and homebrew nes dev graphics ) and character sets . chr files are used to draw 8x8 tiles for homebrew nes development . to draw graphics for the nes such as backgrounds or sprites , they must be pieced together using 8x8 pixel tiles constrained to 4 colors . the contents of a chr file can be summed up as multiple lines of bit strings . for example , take the first line of the chr file for the game super mario bros. when reading the file , it is interpreted as 2 equal length bit strings , such as the position of these 2 bit strings represent a pixel in an 8x8 tile , going in row-column order . the color of the pixel can be found out using a simple formula : the color is irrelevant because it is chosen through the code by the programmer with the attribute table , so it is the bit combination that is significant and there is no storage of color values
