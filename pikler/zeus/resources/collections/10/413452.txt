Madeiran wall lizard     the madeira wall lizard ( `` teira dugesii '' ) or madeira lizard is a species of lizard in the lacertidae family , and the only member of the genus `` teira '' . this madeira wall lizard is endemic to the madeira islands , portugal , where it is abundant . in the azores , this lizard is found after involuntary introduction during the 19th century by ship trade between the two archipelagos , but the lizards have never reached the population numbers as in their territory of origin . there is also a small population in the port area of lisbon , probably accidentally transported in ships carrying bananas , and first found in 1992 ; a study of 2001 found that the population has remained stable in size since its discovery . the species was named after the french zoologist louis antoine dugès ( 1797–1838 ) . the subspecies `` teira dugesii mauli '' ( mertens , 1938 ) from the desertas islands now is a synonym of `` teira dugesii dugesii '' . `` atlantolacerta andreanskyi '' ( andreansky 's lizard ) from morocco , and `` scelarcis perspicillata '' ( menorca wall lizard ) from morocco , algeria and minorca , were in the genus `` teira '' but now are in other genera .
