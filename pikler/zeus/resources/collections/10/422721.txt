Marrella     marrella splendens is an arthropod known from the middle cambrian burgess shale of british columbia . it is the most common animal in the burgess shale . `` marrella '' was the first fossil collected by charles doolittle walcott from the burgess shale , in 1909. walcott described `` marrella '' informally as a `` lace crab '' and described it more formally as an odd trilobite . in 1971 , whittington did a thorough redescription of the animal . on the basis of its legs , gills and head appendages , he decided that it was not a trilobite , nor a chelicerate , nor a crustacean . `` marrella '' -like organisms are found in other cambrian deposits . they are known from sediments as late as the devonian .
