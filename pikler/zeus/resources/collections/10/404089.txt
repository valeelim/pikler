Electroencephalography     electroencephalography is a way to record certain patterns of brain activity , on the skin of the head . nerve cells use electricity to transmit information . it is one of the methods of diagnosis which can be used for conditions that affect the nerves . an electroencephalogram is a recorded electroencephalography . both are abbreviated eeg . electroencephalography is used to detect epilepsy , coma , sleep and brain death . special adaptations exists to research sleep , for example the length of sleep rhythms . sleep occurs in different phases , the specially adapted eeg can show the length of these phases . one way that scientists study eeg recordings is by looking at different waves in the eeg . these waves do not move across the body , but occur as changes in the signal at one place over time . they are studied using mathematical techniques for separating a signal into different frequencies . the slowest waves are called delta , and they occur at 1 to 4 cycles per second . delta occurs in sleep and during anesthesia . the next frequency is called theta , and it occurs at 4 to 8 cycles per second . theta is seen when a person is trying to keep many different things , such as numbers or words , in memory . it is also seen when a person is drowsy . after theta comes alpha , a wave occurring at 8 to 12 cycles per second . alpha is seen over the back of the head when a person has his or her eyes shut . it is also seen when a person is resting or meditating . faster than alpha is beta , a wave that occurs at 12 to 30 cycles per second . it is seen when a person is getting ready to move or no longer resting . it is also seen when a person takes benzodiazepine drugs . finally , gamma is the fastest wave seen in eeg , occurring at 30 to 100 cycles per second . it is seen when a person is thinking or paying attention to something .
