Translocation (botany)    translocation ( botany ) translocation in plants means the movement organic molecules and some mineral ions . movement of water from the soil to the leaves occurs in xylem vessels in a process called transpiration . transpiration , the evaporation of water from leaves , causes a pull on the water column due to the forces of cohesion between water molecules formed due to hydrogen bonds which causes the water to move upwards . organic materials , mainly produced in the leaves , are moved around the plant in the living cells of the phloem by a process called translocation . transpiration was first worked out by stephen hales ( 17 september 1677 â€“ 4 january 1761 ) , an english clergyman . he proved what is still believed , that the evaporation of water molecules from leaves is the main force pulling the water column up from its origin in the roots . unlike xylem ( which is composed of dead cells ) , the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap . sap is a water-based solution , rich in sugars made by the photosynthesis . these sugars are transported to non-photosynthetic parts of the plant , such as the roots , or into storage structures , such as tubers or bulbs .
