The Children's Magazine    the children 's magazine the children 's magazine was the first magazine for children published in the united states . its run was brief , however ; it only appeared between january and april 1789. contents included pieces on school subjects ( like geography ) , verses , and articles on social values . lack of contributions from competent writers forced the editor to republish material from `` the juvenile magazine '' , a monthly london magazine of 1788 . `` the children 's magazine '' folded after four issues , probably in part because the united states postal system in 1789 was not up to handling the distribution of magazines . `` the children 's magazine '' was published in hartford , connecticut and printed by hudson & goodwin . a notice in hartford 's `` connecticut courant '' on february 2 , 1789 alerted readers to its publication and intent : calculated for the use of families and schools ... each number of this work will contain 48 pages , duodecimo , printed on good paper and letter , and will be sold at four shillings and six-pence a dozen , or six pence a single number . this work is designed to furnish children , from seven to twelve years of age , with a variety of lessons on various subjects , written in a plain , familiar style , and proper to lead them from the easy language of spelling-books up to the more difficult style of the best writers . teachers of schools have long complained of the want of such a work , and the publishers are happy that they are now enabled to furnish it at a small expence .
