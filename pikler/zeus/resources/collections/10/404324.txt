List of dialling codes in the United Kingdom     this is a list of dialling codes for telephones in the united kingdom . dialling codes are the basis for the national telephone numbering plan . they are prefixed to all telephone numbers , generally depending on the type of number and its geographic location . the numbering plan is maintained by ofcom , which is an independent communications authority . this list is based on the official standard , but it also shows older codes and historical changes . dialling codes do not match any specific political boundaries . for example , the dialling code for coventry covers a large area of warwickshire and the manchester dialling code covers part or all of several neighbouring towns . when dialling a number from within the united kingdom , all area codes start with a 0. when dialling from outside the country , the prefix is not dialed . `` for an explanation of the two letter std codes used below , see introduction of area codes '' 01426 , 01523 and other non-standard 01 prefixes were briefly used for pagers in the late 1990s and then moved to new 076 prefixes in the big number change in 2000/2001 .
