Jan Swammerdam     jan swammerdam ( 12 february 1637 – 17 february 1680 ) was a dutch biologist and microscopist . his work on insects showed that the stages an insect life – egg , larva , pupa , and adult – are different forms of the same animal . he did experiments on muscle contraction . in 1658 , he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells . he was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections , and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years . knowledge of insects in the 17th century was to a great extent inherited from aristotle . swammerdam dissected insects and studied them under microscopes . swammerdam showed that insects develop in the same gradual manner as do other animals . he wanted to dispel the seventeenth-century idea that different life stages of an insect ( e.g . caterpillar and butterfly ) were different individuals . he got evidence from his dissections . by examining larvae , he identified adult features in pre-adult animals . for example , he noticed that the wings of dragonflies and mayflies exist before their final molt . swammerdam used these observations in his 1669 publication , `` historia insectorum generalis '' ( the natural history of insects ) . this work included many descriptions of insect anatomy . it was here that swammerdam revealed that the `` king '' bee has ovaries . `` biblia natura '' published posthumously in 1737 , carried the first confirmation that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony . despite five intense years of beekeeping , the mode of honey bee reproduction escaped him as he wrote , `` i do not believe the male bees actually copulate with the females .
