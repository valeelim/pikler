Feral     a feral organism is a plant or animal which has changed from being tame or cultivated to being wild . a feral animal is one which has escaped from a domestic or captive status and is living more or less as a wild animal . animals which were wild before they escaped from captivity are not regarded as feral . for example , a lion which has escaped from a zoo is not a feral animal . some common examples of animals with feral populations are goats , cats , and pigs . domesticated plants that revert to wild are usually known as escaped , introduced or naturalized rather than feral . however , the changes seen in plants that go wild is similar to those of animals . some species go feral easily and successfully . other species usually do not usually survive in the wild . the introduction of animals or plants to new areas may break down ecosystems . in some cases it has caused the extinction native species . however , returning lost species to their environment can have the opposite effect , bringing damaged ecosystems back into balance . however , sometimes feral species may control other `` problem '' species such as rodents , harmful insects , or aggressive plants .
