Sacco and Vanzetti     nicola sacco ( 22 april 1891 – 23 august 1927 ) and bartolomeo vanzetti ( 11 june 1888 – 23 august 1927 ) were two italian men who were convicted of murder in the united states in 1920. they were convicted of killing two men during an armed robbery in braintree , massachusetts . sacco and vanzetti were immigrants to the country . both were anarchists who supported rebellion against governments that were violent and oppressive . they were put on trial in 1921. they were convicted even though evidence was clear that they had not committed the crime . this evidence involved ballistics tests and several witnesses who claimed sacco had been in boston and vanzetti in plymouth on the day of the robbery . the two men were carrying weapons when they were arrested . to explain this , sacco and vanzetti had to explain their anarchist beliefs in court . it is believed that this may have prejudiced the jury ( influenced their decision ) . the jury found sacco and vanzetti guilty of murder on 14 july 1921. the case drew attention from around the world . as details of the trial became public , many protests were held against their conviction . sacco and vanzetti were eventually executed on 23 august 1927. since their deaths , scholars have mostly agreed that sacco and vanzetti were wrongfully convicted . they also did not speak english so they could not get a defense themselves . this would not have mattered because they could not afford one ( they did not have enough money ) anyway .
