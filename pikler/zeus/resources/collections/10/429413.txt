Couesnon     the couesnon river ( ) is a river . it starts in the `` département '' of mayenne in north-western france . it forms an estuary at mont-saint-michel . its last stretch is the border between the historical duchies of normandy and brittany . in the past , its course changed often between two beds . they are on the north and south of the mont saint-michel . in the end , it settled to the south bed . this created ( `` made '' ) the saying `` the couesnon 's madness placed mont saint-michel in normandy '' ( `` in french '' , `` le couesnon en sa folie mit le mont en normandie '' ) , as the mount is just to the norman side of the river 's mouth , now . however , the administrative boundary which separates the two regions does not depend on the course of the river . the border is about six kilometres west of the mount . the couesnon , the sée and the sélune form part of the complex water system of the bay of mont saint-michel . on one side , the tide brings lots of sediment . this causes large sandbars within the river . on the other side , the three rivers bring the sediment back to sea .
