Singapore strategy     the singapore strategy was a strategy about defending the british empire in the asian far east , mainly against the empire of japan . the strategy involved a number of different plans and stages , developed between 1919 and 1941. the basic idea was to base a fleet of ships in the far east . this fleet could then be used to stop and defeat a japanese force heading towards india or australia . in 1919 , singapore was chosen because of its strategic location at the end of the strait of malacca . the planners thought that a war with japan would have three phases : while the garrison of singapore defended the fortress , the fleet would make its way to singapore , so that it could relieve or recapture hong kong . the fleet could also impose a blockade on the japanese home islands , which would force the japanese to accept terms . the planners did not think it was practical to invade japan . the planners also thought that the japanese would fight a naval battle . japan consists of many islands . the planners therefore thought that economic pressure would be enough .
