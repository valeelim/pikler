Coupling constant     every force has a coupling constant , which is a measure of its strength in an interaction . the coupling constant determines the chances of one particle to emit or absorb another particle . in electromagnetism , for example , the coupling constant is based on the electric charge . a coupling constant plays an important role in dynamics . when physicists study the quantum behaviour of electromagnetism , they can not solve the whole theory exactly , because every particle may emit and absorb many other particles , which may also do the same , endlessly . so events of emission and absorption are considered as perturbations and are dealt with by a series of approximations . this also can happen in string theory . string theories have a coupling constant . it determines the probability that a 1-dimensional string of energy will separate into `` two '' separate energy strings . but unlike in particle theories , the string coupling constant is not just a number , but depends on one of the oscillation modes of the string .
