Pannotia     pannotia ( or greater gondwanaland and vendian supercontinent ) is a neoproterozoic supercontinent . it may have existed during the ediacaran period ( ~600 million years ago ) , to the end of the precambrian ( about 541 mya ) . after that , it split into smaller continents . the small ones were laurentia , siberia and baltica , with the main landmass gondwana south of them . about 750 million years ago the older supercontinent rodinia split apart into three continents . they were earlier forms of laurasia and gondwana , and the continental craton of congo . about 600 milion years ago , they formed pannotia . pannotia was short-lived . the collisions that formed pannotia were brief collisions , and the continents making up pannotia already had active rifting . by about 550 million years ago , or only about 50 million years after pannotia formed , pannotia separated into four continents . later the landmasses would recombine to form the most recent supercontinent , pangaea . related pages . - plate tectonics
