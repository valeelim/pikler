Cycle of abuse     cycle of abuse is the name of a theory that was developed to explain certain patterns in an abusive relationship , and in domestic violence . lenore walker developed the theory in the 1970s , after she had observed that there is a pattern that repeats in such relationships : 1. tension building phase - this occurs before an aggression 1. acting-out phase - there are violent incidents , some of the incidents may also be abusive 1. reconciliation/honeymoon phase - the parties either get together again and there is an apology , or the incidents are simply ignored . 1. calm phase - during this phase , the relationship looks normal ; there will be some difficulties . these difficulties lead to another tension-building phase . walker 's cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence . however , researchers have occasionally criticised walker 's methodology , preconceptions or findings .
