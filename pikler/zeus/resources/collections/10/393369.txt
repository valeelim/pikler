Milutin Milanković     milutin milanković 28 may 1879 – 12 december 1958 ) was a serbian mathematician , astronomer , geophysicist , climatologist , civil engineer and writer . milanković made two fundamental contributions to science . the first contribution was the `` canon of the earth ’ s insolation '' , which explained the climates of the planets of the solar system . he founded cosmic climatology by calculating temperatures of the upper layers of the earth 's atmosphere as well as the temperature conditions on planets of the inner solar system , mercury , venus , mars , and the moon , as well as the depth of the atmosphere of the outer planets . the second contribution was his explanation of how the earth 's long-term climate changes are caused by changes in earth 's spin and orbit around the sun . this is now known as milankovich cycles . this explains the ice ages which occurred in the geological past of the earth , and predicts climate changes on the earth which may be expected in the future . the explanation is not entirely accurate , so no doubt there are other factors also at work . these other factors would be such things as how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in the atmosphere , the position of the continents , the amount of volcanic action , and so on . however , the cycles of climate do seem broadly to go as milankovic predicted . geological evidence from rhythmical features in sedimentary rocks are common .
