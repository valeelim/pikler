Gesso     gesso is a primer or foundation for art painting on wood or canvas . it is a white paint mixture . it has a binder mixed with a pigment . traditionally , the binder is glue or gelatin , the pigment is chalk , plaster or gypsum . gesso is used in art to prepare a surfaces ( wood panels , canvas and sculpture ) for painting . paint and/or other materials are applied on top of the gesso . one reason for covering the surface with gesso is that wood or canvas has a rough or uneven surface , and a colour . gesso `` priming '' lets the artist 's chosen subject show more clearly than it would otherwise . even if a surface has no roughness , many artists still prime it before starting the painting proper , though they might use a paint or `` wash '' of their own choosing . they do this because the primer , though it can not be seen directly , may change and help the quality of light reflected from the surface . gesso , however , is specially useful for a rough or uneven surface . acrylic gesso , a widely used `` ground '' , is a modern version which is cheaper and easier to use than the traditional type of gesso . it is a combination of calcium carbonate with an acrylic polymer medium latex , a pigment and other chemicals to ensure flexibility and increase life . it is technically not `` gesso '' at all. < /sup >
