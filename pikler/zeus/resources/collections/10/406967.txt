Promoter (genetics)    promoter ( genetics ) in genetics , a promoter is a section of dna which starts the transcription of a gene . promoters are near the genes they transcribe . they are on the same strand of dna and are 'upstream ' . promoters can be about 100â€“1000 base pairs long . for the transcription to take place , the enzyme that makes rna , known as rna polymerase , must attach to the dna near a gene . promoters contain specific dna sequences which give the rna polymerase a place to bind . other proteins also help this to happen . some can also stop it from happening . the whole thing is called `` the regulation of gene expression '' . - in bacteria : the promoter is recognized by rna polymerase and another protein . - in eukaryotes : the process is more complicated . at least seven different factors are needed so rna polymerase ii can bind to the promoter . promoters are important parts of the dna . they work with other regulatory regions . together , they adjust the level of transcription of a gene . so , genes get switched on when they are needed , and switched off when they are not . when they are on , they get adjusted up or down as needed .
