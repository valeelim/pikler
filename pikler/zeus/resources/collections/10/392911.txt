'' he spent his youth as a slave in rome to epaphroditos , a rich freedman and secretary to nero . the city was near the modern-day town of pamukkale in turkey . he died around 135 ad in nikopolis in epirus , in greece . he was one of the most influential philosophers of the late stoa . epictetus founded a school of philosophy , where he also taught . none of his writing survive , but one of his pupils , arrian , wrote what he was taught . philosophy , epictetus taught , is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline . to epictetus , all external events are determined by fate , and are thus beyond our control ; we should accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately . however , individuals are responsible for their own actions , which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline .
