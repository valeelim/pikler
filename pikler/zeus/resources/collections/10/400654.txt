Ensete     ensete is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of africa and asia . it is one of the three genera in the banana family , musaceae , and includes the false banana or enset ( `` e. ventricosum '' ) , an economically important foodcrop in ethiopia . the genus `` ensete '' was first described by paul fedorowitsch horaninow ( 1796-1865 ) in his `` prodromus monographiae scitaminarum '' of 1862 in which he created a single species , `` ensete edule '' . however , the genus did not receive general recognition until 1947 when it was revived by e. e. cheesman in the first of a series of papers in the `` kew bulletin '' on the classification of the bananas , with a total of 25 species . taxonomically , the genus `` ensete '' has been reduced since cheesman restore the taxon . cheesman acknowledged that field study might reveal synonymy and the most recent review of the genus by simmonds ( 1960 ) listed just six . the plant list accepts eight species as valid . the plants of `` ensete '' are very large herbs without branches that die after producing seeds ; they have only one stem that remains short until flowering .
