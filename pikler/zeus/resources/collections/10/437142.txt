John Ostrom     john harold ostrom ( february 18 , 1928 â€“ july 16 , 2005 ) was an american paleontologist . in the 1960s , he showed that dinosaurs are more like big non-flying birds than they are like lizards ( or `` saurians '' ) . thomas henry huxley in the 1860s had thought birds evolved from dinosaurs , based on a comparison of `` archaeopteryx '' with `` compsognathus '' . huxley 's idea was later discarded , mainly because heilmann , in 1926 , had different views . the first of ostrom 's reviews of the osteology and phylogeny of the primitive bird `` archaeopteryx '' appeared in 1976. after the modern discoveries of fossil dinobirds in china , the huxleyostrom theory was accepted by almost all palaeontologists . ostrom was a professor at yale university . he was the curator emeritus of vertebrate paleontology at the peabody museum of natural history , which has an impressive fossil collection started by othniel charles marsh . he died from complications of alzheimer 's disease . his 1964 discovery of `` deinonychus '' was one of the most important fossil finds in history . `` deinonychus '' was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its `` terrible claw '' . evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail , making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running . the conclusion that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism , and were therefore warm-blooded , was popularized by his student robert bakker . this helped to change the impression of dinosaurs as the sluggish , slow , cold-blooded lizards which had prevailed since the turn of the century .
