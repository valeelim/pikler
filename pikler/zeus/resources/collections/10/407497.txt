Emberizidae     emberizidae is a large family of passerine birds , which are typically known as buntings in the old world and american sparrows in the new world . they are seed-eating birds with a finch-like bill . these birds are not closely related to the ( old world ) sparrows , the family passeridae . the family also includes the north american birds known as juncos and towhees . the emberizidae family probably originated in south america and spread first into north america before crossing into eastern asia and continuing to move west . this explains the comparative paucity of emberizid species in europe and africa when compared to the americas . like wih several other passerine families , this family 's taxonomy is in a state of flux . many genera in south and central america are more closely related to tanager clades , and at least one tanager genus ( `` chlorospingus '' ) may belong here in the emberizidae .
