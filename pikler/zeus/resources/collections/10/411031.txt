Spherical geometry     spherical geometry is the use of geometry on a sphere . it was started for cartography , as well as for making maps of stars . it is different from euclidean geometry ( which is always on a plane ) , and non-euclidean geometry . points are defined in the same way as they are in euclidean geometry : a point is at a defined location on the sphere . a `` staight line '' is different though : it is the shortest path between two points , which stays on the surface of the plane . some theorems of euclidean geometry can not be used on the sphere , many of them have been adapted though .
