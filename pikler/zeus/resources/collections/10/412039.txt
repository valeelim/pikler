Lateral line     the lateral line is a system of sense organs found in fish , and not in land vertebrates . it detects movement and vibration in the surrounding water . modified epithelial cells , known as hair cells , respond to changes around the fish . these turn the changes into electrical impulses which go to their central nervous system . lateral lines are used in schooling , predation , and orientation . for example , fish use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey . they are faint lines running lengthwise down each side , from the gill covers to the base of the tail . in some species , the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors , which are organs used to detect electrical impulses . most amphibian larvae and some fully aquatic adult amphibians have systems which work a bit like the lateral line .
