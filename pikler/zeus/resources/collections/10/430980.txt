Hyades cluster     the hyades ( also known as melotte 25 or collinder 50 ) is the nearest open star cluster to the solar system and one of the best-studied of all star clusters . the hipparcos satellite , the hubble space telescope , and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting agree a distance of ~153 ly ( 47 pc ) to the cluster centre . the distances given by these three independent methods make the hyades an important rung on the cosmic distance ladder . the cluster consists of a roughly spherical group of hundreds of stars sharing the same age , place of origin , chemical content , and motion through space . from the perspective of observers on earth , the hyades cluster is in the constellation taurus , where its brightest stars form a `` v '' shape with the even brighter red giant aldebaran . aldebaran is completely unrelated to the hyades , because it is much closer to earth ( hence its apparent brightness ) and just happens to lie along the same line of sight . the four brightest member stars of the hyades are all red giants that began life as a-type stars and have now evolved off the main sequence . all are within a few light years of each other . their bayer designations are gamma , delta , epsilon , and theta tauri . they form a pattern which was identified as the head of taurus the bull . epsilon tauri , also known as ain ( the `` bull 's eye '' ) , harbours at least one gas giant planet .
