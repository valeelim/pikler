Chaperone (protein)    chaperone ( protein ) molecular chaperones are proteins which help large molecules fold or unfold . some help assemble or take apart other macromolecular structures . they do not occur in these structures when the structures go about their normal functions . the first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and dna . those assembly chaperones , especially in the nucleus , assemble folded subunits into larger structures such as cell organelles . one major function of chaperones is to prevent polypeptide chains and assembled subunits sticking together in clumps which do not function . some chaperones are `` holdases '' which act to stop aggregation . others , called `` foldases '' , do help fold proteins which can not do it themselves . such proteins violate anfinsen 's dogma .
