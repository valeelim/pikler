Mir Sultan Khan     malik mir sultan khan ( 1905 – 25 april 1966 ) was the strongest chess master of his time from asia . he was a manservant from british india who travelled with his master , colonel nawab sir umar hayat khan , to britain , where he took the chess world by storm . in an international chess career of less than five years ( 1929–33 ) , he won the british chess championship three times in four tries ( 1929 , 1932 , 1933 ) , and had tournament and match results that put him among the top ten players in the world . sir umar then brought him back to his homeland , where he gave up chess and returned to his humble life . he has been called `` perhaps the greatest natural player of modern times '' . he was generally recognised as a grandmaster , but when fide took over control of chess , he was forgotten . at the fide 1948 meeting , a number of former players were given retrospective titles , but not khan . sultan khan learned the indian form of chess from his father at the age of nine . this was a form of chess which was similar to modern chess , but still had some features of the old arabic chess . the main feature was that pawns did not move two squares on their first move . therefore , the role of opening theory was less important , and gemes developed more slowly .
