Forty-seven Ronin     the revenge of the forty-seven ronin took place in japan at the start of the 18th century . it describes a historical event , but there is a lot of fiction added to the story too . the story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless ( becoming `` ronin '' ) after their daimyo ( lord ) asano naganori had to kill himself by committing `` seppuku '' ( ritual suicide ) . he had to do this because he assaulted a court official named kira yoshinaka . the `` ronin '' waited and planned almost two years , and then killed kira to avenge their master 's honour . they delivered kira 's head to asano 's grave . after that , the `` ronin '' had to kill themselves by committing `` seppuku '' as they had committed the crime of murder . one noted japanese scholar described the tale , the most famous example of the samurai code of honor , `` bushid≈ç , '' as the country 's `` national legend .
