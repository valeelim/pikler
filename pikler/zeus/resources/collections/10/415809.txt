Fluorescence     fluorescence is the light given off by certain substances when it absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation . first the substance absorbs the energy , then it emits light . when the light source is removed , the fluorescence stops occurring . it is a form of luminescence . in most cases , the light given off has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light . one of the most surprising types of fluorescence is when a substance absorbs ultraviolet light that can not be seen by the human eye , but gives off visible light . fluorescence is used in many fields such as mineralogy , gemology , chemical sensors ( fluorescence spectroscopy ) , dyes , biological detectors , and fluorescent lights . fluorescence in the life sciences is a way of tracking biological molecules . a protein or other component can have a fluorescent dye attached to it , which allows a scientist to visually find the specific protein with a microscope .
