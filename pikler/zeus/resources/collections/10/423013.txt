GD 61     gd 61 is a white dwarf star . it is 150 light-years from earth in the constellation perseus . an asteroid in the system was detected in 2013 that contains water . this was the first finding of solid or liquid water on an extrasolar body . the asteroid , the first extrasolar asteroid detected , is 26 % water by mass , close to the water content of ceres . this means that a planet , with a rocky surface similar to earth 's , may have existed in the past . the asteroid could be an artifact from this period . it is now possibly part of a debris field from that planet 's breakup . such a planet would have had both a rocky surface and water . these are two key ingredients for life . the researchers used the cosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble space telescope to determine what it is made of . the elements magnesium , silicon , iron and oxygen were detected . these are all components of rocky planets . however , the amount of oxygen is much higher than what was expected . there was also less carbon than expected . this meant there was one possible reason for the extra oxygen . there had to be water there .
