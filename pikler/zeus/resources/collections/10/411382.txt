Frequency response     systems respond differently to inputs of different frequencies . some systems may amplify frequencies of certain range and attenuate the other frequencies . the way that the system output is related to the input for different frequencies is called frequency response . frequency response means a graph where can be seen how something changes in different sound frequency . it is typically used in loudspeakers . also audio crossovers way to function can be shown with frequency response .
