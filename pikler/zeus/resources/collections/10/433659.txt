Spiderwebs     `` spiderwebs '' is a pop rock song by no doubt . the lyrics are about a man who keeps calling gwen and reciting bad poetry to her . it was released as a single in 1995. on the record charts it peaked near # 5 three weeks after release . two separate music videos were made . one had exploding telephones . the other was set in a japanese restaurant . music television ( mtv ) thought the telephone explosions were not good for young viewers to see , so they added more footage of the band .
