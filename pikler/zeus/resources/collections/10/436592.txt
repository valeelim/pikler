Bedrock     in stratigraphy , bedrock is the common term for solid rock under the surface of the earth . above the bedrock is usually an area of broken and weathered rock , soil , sand , pebbles , etc . the top of the bedrock is known as the rockhead and identifying this , via excavations , drilling or geophysical methods , is an important task in most civil engineering projects . loose material on top ( known as drift ) can be extremely thick , so that the bedrock lies hundreds of meters below the surface . a 'solid ' geologic map of an area will usually show the rock that would be exposed at the surface if all soil or other superficial deposits were removed .
