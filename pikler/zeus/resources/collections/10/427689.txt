Power factor     in electrical engineering , the power factor ( pf or cosÏ† ) is the ratio between the power that can be used in electric circuit ( real power , p ) and the power from the result of multiplication between the current and voltage circuit ( apparent power , s ) . the power factor is defined as : pf ranges from zero to one . the higher the pf , the more efficient the circuit is because more power can be used , and vice versa . factors that can cause pf to be less than one is non-linear load , which are capacitive load and inductive load .
