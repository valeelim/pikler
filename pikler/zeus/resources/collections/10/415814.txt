Luminescence     luminescence is light emitted by a substance not caused by heat . in contrast , incandescence is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating . luminescence can be caused by chemical reactions , electrical energy , subatomic motions , or piezoelectricity ( stress on a crystal ) . the term 'luminescence ' was introduced in 1888 by eilhard wiedemann . the dials , hands , scales and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as 'luminising ' . some types of luminescence . - chemiluminescence , the making light from a chemical reaction . - bioluminescence , emission as a result of biochemical reaction by a living organism - fluorescence , emission after higher-energy electromagnetic radiation is applied - phosphorescence , same cause , but emission is delayed , lasting sometimes for hours - electroluminescence : light-emitting diodes ( leds )
