Midterm exam     a midterm exam is a test given around the middle of a term in schools . midterm exams can be given for several reasons . first , it allows a student to see if they need to change how they study for the class ( if they do not do well on the exam ) or if they should continue to study the same way for the rest of the term ( if they do well ) . this tells a student who does not do well that they should drop the class . many colleges stop allowing students to drop a class a week or two after the first midterm exam . midterm exams can also show how well a teacher is doing in teaching their class . some teachers give more than one midterm exam .
