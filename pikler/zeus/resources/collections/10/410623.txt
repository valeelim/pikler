Lesbianism in erotica     lesbianism has been performed in visual arts since the times of ancient rome . for much of history of cinema and television , lesbianism was regarded as taboo . but since the 1960s , it has increasingly become a theme within its own right . it was first used in softcore movies and erotic thrillers during the 1980s . acts of lovemaking between women first happened during several movies in the late 1960s : `` the killing of sister george '' , `` therese and isabelle '' and `` the fox '' . lesbian scenes during movies are always subject to controversy . many people say that the mpaa has been harsh on movies with homosexual themes . one notable example of this regards the movie `` when night is falling '' , which was given an nc-17 , but released unrated .
