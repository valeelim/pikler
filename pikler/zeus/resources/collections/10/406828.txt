Schlieffen Plan     the schlieffen plan was a strategic plan called `` aufmarsch i west '' made by count alfred von schlieffen and the german general staff . it was made for the army of the german empire in 1905. it was designed for a war between france on one side and the german empire , austria-hungary , and italy on the other . germany and her allies would invade france through belgium . with help from her allies , germany would have just enough men to beat france in a few months . when schlieffen retired in 1906 , helmuth von moltke the younger took over the german empire 's war planning . moltke got rid of the plan because he was sure that the russian empire and the united kingdom would help france and that italy would not help germany . moltke was right about this . when world war i started , germany and austria-hungary had to fight russia on the eastern front and italy did not help germany . even though he did not have enough men to beat france , moltke still attacked france through belgium . he did this because he thought attacking was always better than defending . moltke was sure that the russo-japanese war proved this because japan always attacked , and japan won .
