Armillaria gallica     armillaria gallica ( synonymous with `` a. bulbosa '' and `` a. lutea '' ) is a species of `` honey mushroom '' in the agaricales order . the species is common and ecologically important : it decays wood . it can live as a saprophyte , or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or butt rot . it is found in temperate regions of asia , north america , and europe . the species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood . the fungus has been accidentally introduced to south africa . `` armillaria gallica '' is a largely subterranean fungus , and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about in diameter , yellow-brown , and covered with small scales . on the underside of the caps are gills that are white to creamy or pale orange . the fungus develops an extensive system of underground root-like structures , called rhizomorphs which help it to decompose dead wood in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests . it has been the subject of considerable scientific research . its ability to bioluminesce and its ability to form large and long-lived colonies are especially interesting .
