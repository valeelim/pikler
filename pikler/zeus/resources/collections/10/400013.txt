Fibrinogen     fibrinogen is the clotting element present in blood . when blood comes out of a wound in a vessel , the fibrinogen is activated and forms fibrin , which clots the blood . although this is fibrinogen 's main job , it also forms bridges between platelets . fibrinogen is a protein made by the liver . it is a dimer ( made up of two similar units ) . each unit has an alpha , beta , and gamma chain . the alpha and beta chains have a small peptide called fibrinopeptide . when fibrinogen is activated to form fibrin , an enzyme called thrombin cleaves the fibrinopeptides off of the alpha and beta chains . it is possible to examine a small sample of a person 's blood to find out how much fibrinogen is in the blood . this helps medical professionals to know if too much or too little fibrinogen is the cause of a patient 's medical problems .
