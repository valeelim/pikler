Draco (lawgiver)    draco ( lawgiver ) draco ( 7th century bc ) was the first legislator of the city of athens in ancient greece . he wrote laws that were to be enforced only by a court . this constitution replaced the system of oral law and blood feuding that had governed athens since the city was founded . draco 's laws were known for being harsh . the word draconian has come to mean unforgiving rules or laws . draco established this legal system during the 39th olympiad , in about 622 or 621 bc . the laws ( - `` thesmoi '' ) he set formed the first written constitution of athens . they were displayed in public , so that nobody would be unaware of them . the death penalty was the punishment for most crimes , even minor ones . plutarch states : `` it was a lot for himself , when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences , answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it , and he had no greater punishment for more important ones . '' not much is known about draco 's life or who he was . the 10th-century suda text tells a legendary story of his death . he was said to have died on the stage of the theatre in aegina . in a traditional ancient greek show of approval , his supporters threw so many hats and pieces of clothing onto his head that he suffocated .
