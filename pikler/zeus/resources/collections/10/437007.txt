Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia     the royal flying doctor service of australia ( rfds ) is a medical service in australia . it was the first flying medical service in the world . it provides emergency and other health care to people living in rural and remote areas . it is a not-for-profit organisation . communities in the outback and the bush are generally small , and spread over large distances . many farms , stations and outstations are located far from towns over rough trails . because of this , many of these places do not have access to hospitals or doctors . the flying doctor service brings medical service to them . it can land planes in any community that has an airstrip . today it has a fleet of about 60 planes . they fly from 21 bases located across australia . the service was started by reverend john flynn . he had worked in rural areas of victoria . in 1912 , he was asked by the presbyterian church to look at the needs of people living in the northern territory . his report about it led to the creation of the australian inland mission ( aim ) . flynn became the manager of this . it began as one nursing clinic . by 1926 , it had become a network of ten nursing clinics .
