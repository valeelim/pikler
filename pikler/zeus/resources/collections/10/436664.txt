Linear function     in basic mathematics , a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line in 2-dimensions ( see images ) . an example is : `` y '' =2 '' x '' –1 . in higher mathematics , a linear function often refers to a linear mapping . formally , a linear function is a function `` f '' ( `` x '' ) : r→r such that the graph of `` f '' is a line . this means the domain or input of `` f '' is a real number r and the range or output of `` f '' is also a real number r. usually we write `` y '' ( `` x '' ) or just `` y '' in place of `` f '' ( `` x '' ) . so the formal statement means : - we input or substitute a real number `` x '' into the linear function - the linear function outputs or gives a real number `` y '' and - all of these points ( `` x '' , '' y '' ) make a line . there are three main forms for writing linear functions : slope-intercept , standard and parametric . the slope-intercept ( also called point-slope or explicit ) form of a linear function is formula_1 or formula_2 . this form has 2 variables `` x '' and `` у '' and 2 constants `` m '' and `` b '' . - the letters `` m '' and `` b '' are constants . before working with a linear function , we replace `` m '' and `` b '' with actual real numbers .
