Polar vortex     the polar vortex ( alternate names : arctic cyclone or polar vortice ) is a persistent large-scale cyclone located near geographical poles of a planet . on earth , a polar vortex is usually in the middle and upper troposphere and stratosphere . the cyclone surrounds the polar highs . polar storms lie in the wake of the polar front . they strengthen in the winter and weaken near summer . these vortexes span usually between 620 to 1,240 miles . they circulate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere . similar to hurricanes , a coriolis effect causes the rotation of a polar vortex . the arctic vortex has two main centers : one is over the baffin island , the other is over northeastern siberia .
