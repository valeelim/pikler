Photodiode     a photodiode is a light sensitive semiconductor . it is a type of photodetector capable of changing ( or converting ) light into either current or voltage , depending upon the mode of operation . if the anode and cathode leads of a photodiode are joined together by a wire , when in the dark , no current will flow . on the other hand , when in the light , current flows from the cathode to the anode . the diode part of a photodiode allows current to flow in only one direction . photodiodes may contain optical filters , built-in lenses , and may have large or small surface areas . photodiodes usually have a slower as its surface area increases . the common , traditional solar cell used to generate electric solar power is a large area photodiode . photodiodes and look the same physically but have different functions .
