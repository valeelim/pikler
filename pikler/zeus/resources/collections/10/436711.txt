Coloured     in south african , namibian , zambian , botswanan , and zimbabwean context , the term coloured ( kleurlinge in afrikaans ) is used to refer to people of mixed european and khoisan or bantu ancestry . they form the majority of the northern cape and western cape populations . most coloured speak afrikaans as their first language , although there are some native english speakers . the majority of coloureds living in cape town are able to speak both languages . because of south africa 's history of racial discrimination , many feel that the term `` coloured '' is derogatory . the official term is `` coloured people '' , but many coloureds prefer to call themselves `` black '' , `` khoisan '' , or just `` south african '' . during apartheid , people were classified into four groups : white , black , coloured , and asian . the cape malays , who are of asian descent , were not classified as asians , but as coloureds . although they were discriminated upon by the government , many coloureds and asians got to enjoy certain rights during the apartheid era . for example , they did not have to carry around a passbook , had limited political representation , and were considered citizens of south africa .
