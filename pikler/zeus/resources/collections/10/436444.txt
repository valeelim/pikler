George C. Williams     george christopher williams ( may 12 , 1926 â€“ september 8 , 2010 ) was an american evolutionary biologist . williams was a professor emeritus of biology at the state university of new york at stony brook . he was best known for his critique of group selection , though later in life he recognized that it did sometimes occur . the work of williams in this area , with w.d . hamilton , john maynard smith and others , led to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution . in 1999 williams shared the crafoord prize , with maynard smith and ernst mayr , for developing the concept of evolutionary biology . williams ' 1957 paper `` pleiotropy , natural selection , and the evolution of senescence '' was influential in 20th century evolutionary biology . it contains three important ideas . in this paper williams proposed that senescence should be generally synchronized by natural selection . `` if the adverse genic effects appeared earlier in one system than any other , they would be removed by selection from that system more readily than from any other . in other words , natural selection will always be in greatest opposition to the decline of the most senescence-prone system .
