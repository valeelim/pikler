Nitro compound     a nitro compound is a molecule that has the nitro group . the nitro group is made of one nitrogen atom connected with two oxygen atoms ( -no ) . the nitrogen is also bonded to the rest of the molecule . nitrogen normally has only three bonds . in a nitro group , it is considered positively charged . then one of the oxygen is negatively charged , and the other has a double bond . in reality , the best way to represent the nitro group is to consider it to have delocalized electrons . then all three atoms are sp hybridised . nitro compounds are very explosive . this is because , at high temperature , they can decompose and release nitrogen gas . this reaction is very exothermic ( gives out a lot of energy ) . many explosives have nitro groups , for example trinitrotoluene ( tnt ) .
