Dál Riata     dál riata ( also dalriada or dalriata ) was a kingdom on the western coast of scotland.. beginning in the early 5th century dál riata covered the area of what is now argyll and bute and lochaber in scotland . they came from the area of county antrim in northern ireland where they were called 'scots ' . other groups from ireland followed . these groups also established themselves on the west coast as far south as cornwall . the colony from irish dál riata were known as the `` scotti '' to the romans . it was this group that later gave their name to scotland . at the time they began to colonize dál riata the only other people living in the far north of britain were the picts . they occupied the eastern part of scotland north of what is now edinburgh . about a.d. 297 they were mentioned by roman writers regarding an attack along hadrian 's wall . even at this early period the romans encountered irish `` scotti '' assisting the picts even though they had not yet moved there permanently . so the two groups were seen by the romans to be allies . how dál riata in scotland was seen as a colony still controlled from ireland is not clear to modern historians . some view the dál riatans as having their own local kings with their overlord in ireland . others saw it as being ruled by one king . dál riata became the home of the irish monk saint columba . he established a christian community on the isle of iona . he brought christianity to the whole of scotland , gaels and picts .
