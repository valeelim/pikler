Ballades (Chopin)    ballades ( chopin ) frédéric chopin 's ballades are four one-movement pieces for solo piano . he composed them between 1835 and 1842. the four ballades are said to have been inspired by polish poet adam mickiewicz . the exact inspiration for each individual ballade , however , is unclear and not agreed upon . ballades were composed before chopin , in literature and italian renaissance music . but , chopin invented the `` ballade '' as an abstract musical form . the ballade is a distinct form and can not be placed into another form ( e.g . sonata ) . after chopin , other composers such as franz liszt and johannes brahms also wrote ballades . the ballades are thought to be the best of chopin 's compositions and of romantic music . the ballades are difficult for pianists to play , even after they learn the technical difficulty of the notes . there are still the creative expressions to be mastered . all four ballades are from 8 to 12 minutes in length . they are in triple time ( three beats to a bar ) , or in 6/4 or 6/8 time . each is an individual work and should not be played as a group in a concert . even chopin did not do this . he wanted listeners to find their own interpretation of the music . each piece has its own poetry , drama and story .
