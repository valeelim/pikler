Ableism     ableism or ablecentrism is prejudice towards disabled people . the first known use of the word was in 1981 , which makes it relatively new . however , the concept of ableism existed before this . 'disablism ' can be used to mean the same thing . ableism can be intentional or unintentional . people can be ableist ( prejudiced towards disabled people ) unintentionally because ableism is so common that people may not notice that it exists . a person who holds such a prejudice is called an `` ablecentrist '' . some people say that ableism is a form of oppression . not everyone who talks about ableism agrees about what things are ableist . disabled people can be ableist , to other disabled people or to themselves , which is called internalized ableism . some people deny that ableism exists . in some countries , there are laws that are made to protect disabled people from ableist discrimination and convention on the rights of persons with disabilities also prohibits such discriminations . ableism takes many forms around the world . sometimes ableism is done in a way that is supposed to be hurtful . other times people are ableist while they are trying to be nice . both of these types of ableism are harmful .
