Carcharodontosauridae     the carcharodontosauridae were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs . they are a clade in the carnosauria . carcharodontosaurids included some of the largest land predators ever known : `` giganotosaurus '' , `` mapusaurus '' , `` carcharodontosaurus '' , and `` tyrannotitan '' . all of these rivalled or exceeded `` tyrannosaurus '' in size . together with the spinosaurids , carcharodontosaurids were the largest predators in the early and middle cretaceous throughout gondwana . they were also in north america ( `` acrocanthosaurus '' ) , and asia ( `` shaochilong '' ) . their ages range from 127 to 93 million years ago ( mya ) . after that , they may have been replaced by the smaller abelisaurids in gondwana and by tyrannosaurids in north america and asia . if so , this faunal replacement occurred on a global scale . however , some theropod teeth discovered in the late cretaceous of brazil , as well as a fragment of right maxilla appear to belong to carcharodontosaurids . this suggests the group survived until the latest cretaceous .
