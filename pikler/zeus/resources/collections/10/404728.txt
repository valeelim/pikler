Hoag's object    hoag 's object hoag 's object is a ring galaxy . the galaxy is named after arthur allen hoag who discovered it in 1950. he identified it as either a planetary nebula or an unusual galaxy . the object has about eight billion stars , and is ~600 million light-years away in the constellation serpens . a nearly perfect ring of young hot blue stars circles the older yellow nucleus of this ring galaxy . the inner core of the galaxy is about ( ) , while the surrounding ring has an inner 28″ diameter of ( ) and an outer 45″ diameter of ( ) , which is slightly larger than the milky way galaxy . the gap separating the two stellar populations may contain some star clusters that are almost too faint to see . as rare as this type of galaxy is , another more distant ( and unnamed ) ring galaxy can be seen through hoag 's object , between the nucleus and the outer ring of the galaxy , at roughly the one o'clock position in the picture to the right . art hoag suggested the visible ring was a product of gravitational lensing . this idea was later discarded : the nucleus and the ring have the same redshift , and the ring shows knotty structure which would not be visible with gravitational lensing .
