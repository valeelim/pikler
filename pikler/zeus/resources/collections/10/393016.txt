Transplant (surgery)    transplant ( surgery ) transplants are a type of surgery . both tissues and organs can be transplanted . types of transplant : - heart transplant - lung transplant - heart-lung transplant - kidney transplant - skin graft - xenotransplantation - autotransplantation an organ transplant is a kind of surgery where the person being operated on needs an organ replaced , and gets a healthy one from someone else , a donor . usually the organ is taking from someone is recently deceased , except for organs like bone marrow or kidneys which can be given without harming the donor too much . the critical problem with all transplants is transplant rejection by the host 's immune system . unless the host and donor are a very close genetic match , the host 's immune system will reject the transplant . to stop this happening , drugs are used to suppress the host 's immune system . this in turn makes the host more vulnerable to various kinds of infection . to keep this problem to a minimum , transplants are only done when surgeons are satisfied that the host and donor are a fairly close match . tests are done to see how good a match the donor 's organ of tissue is to the proposed host .
