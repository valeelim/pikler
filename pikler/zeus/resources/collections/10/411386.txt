Audio crossover     audio crossover is an electric circuit that separates low and high audio frequencies in a signal . it is needed because very small loudspeakers ( tweeters ) would break if fed by low frequencies . likewise , bigger speakers ( subwoofers ) are not able to play higher frequencies purely . audio crossovers are divided to passive or active crossovers . typical components used with passive crossovers are capacitors inductors and resistors . if passive crossover uses resistors to adjust loudness , those generate heat . instead , active devices typically use resistors and capacitors with other audioelectronic components and those typically do n't consume so much electric power . also , active crossovers are easily built to be adjustable . still , that does n't mean that using passive crossover means low quality .
