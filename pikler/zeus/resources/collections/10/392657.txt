Barabbas     barabbas is a person from the bible who lived around the time of jesus ( 33 ad ) . he has a bad reputation for being a liar , thief , insurrectionist and zealot . he was released by pontius pilate the roman governor of judea who presided over jesus ' trial . the most notable thing about barabbas is that this name was his surname ( last name ) , but his first name was also jesus . so when pilate — who was warned by his wife to leave this holy man alone — offered to set free one of the prisoners , he was offering the crowd in jerusalem two jesuses to choose from : jesus barabbas or jesus of nazareth . pilate released barabbas and ordered jesus , `` king of the jews '' , to be crucified .
