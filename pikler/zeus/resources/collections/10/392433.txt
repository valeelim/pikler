Venn diagram     a venn diagram is a diagram that shows the logical relation between sets . they were popularised by john venn in the 1880s , and are now widely used . they are used to teach elementary set theory , and to illustrate simple set relationships in probability , logic , statistics , linguistics and computer science . a venn diagram uses closed curves drawn on a plane to represent sets . very often these curves are circles or ellipses . similar ideas had been proposed before venn . christian weise in 1712 ( `` nucleus logicoe wiesianoe '' ) and leonhard euler ( `` letters to a german princess '' ) 1768 , came up with similar ideas . the idea was popularised by venn in `` symbolic logic '' , chapter v `` diagrammatic representation '' , 1881. the following example uses two sets , a and b , represented here as coloured circles . the orange circle , set a , represents all living creatures that are two-legged . the blue circle , set b , represents the living creatures that can fly . each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram . living creatures that both can fly `` and '' have two legs—for example , parrots—are then in both sets , so they correspond to points in the area where the blue and orange circles overlap . that area contains all such and only such living creatures .
