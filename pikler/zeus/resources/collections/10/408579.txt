Chondrophore     the chondrophores or porpitids are a small and unusual group of hydrozoans . they are the family porpitidae . they all live at the surface of the open ocean , and are colonies of carnivorous , free-floating hydroids . their life-style in the plankton is similar to that of pelagic jellyfish . the chondrophores look like a single organism but are cooperatives of polyps . the most familiar members of the family porpitidae are the blue button ( `` porpita porpita '' ) and the by-the-wind sailor ( `` velella velella '' ) . chondrophores may look like a jellyfish , but they really are not . like the siphonophores they are not a single animal . they are a colony of clones , genetically identical zooids . these zooids are small , highly modified individual polyps . though structurally similar to other cnidarians , the zooids do not live by themselves : they are attached to each other . each type of zooid depends for survival on the others doing what it can not do by itself . this kind of set-up is also found in the siphonophores : the portuguese man o ' war . they evolved independently , and are classified in different orders .
