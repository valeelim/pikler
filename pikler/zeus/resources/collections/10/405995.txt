Percival     percivale is the grail knight or one of the grail knights in numerous medieval and modern stories of the grail quest . percivale first appears in chrétien de troyes 's unfinished percivale or conte del graal ( c.1190 ) . the incomplete story prompted a series of `` continuations , '' in the third of which ( c. 1230 ) , by an author named manessier , percivale achieves the grail . ( an analogue to chrétien 's tale is found in the thirteenth-century welsh romance peredur . )
