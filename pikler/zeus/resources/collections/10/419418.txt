Harrow (tool)    harrow ( tool ) a harrow is a farm tool . it is an implement for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the soil . in this way it is different from a plow , which cuts deeper into the soil . a plow also lifts up the soil and tips it over , but a harrow works mostly by cutting into the soil and breaking it up . harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough surface left by plowing . the purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods ( lumps of soil ) and to provide a finer finish , a good tilth or soil structure that is good for planting seeds . it may also be used to remove weeds and to cover up seed after sowing . harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil , instead of disturbing only narrow trails that avoid crop rows ( to kill weeds ) . there are four general types of harrows : disc harrow , tine harrow , chain harrow and chain disk harrows . harrows were originally pulled by draft animals , such as horses , mules , or oxen , or in some times and places by people . in modern practice they are almost always pulled by tractors , either from a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch .
