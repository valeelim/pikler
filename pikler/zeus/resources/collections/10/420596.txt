Ice sheet     an ice sheet is a large mass of glacier ice that covers an area of more than . it may also be called a continental glacier . there are two ice sheets in the world at the moment : in antarctica and greenland . ice sheets are larger than ice shelves or alpine glaciers . masses of ice covering less than 50,000 km are called ice caps . the ice in an ice cap usually comes from a series of glaciers that drain into it . the antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on earth . it covers an area of almost 14 million km and contains 30 million km of ice . around 90 % of the fresh water on the earth 's surface is held in this ice sheet . if all of it were to melt , it would cause sea levels to rise by 58 metres . the ice sheet first formed in the early oligocene . it retreated and advanced many times until the pliocene , when it came to occupy almost all of antarctica . the greenland ice sheet covers about 82 % of the surface of greenland . satellite images from nasa show that it is melting at a rate of about 239 cubic kilometres ( 57.3 cubic miles ) each year . if all of it melted , it would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2 metres . the ice sheet did not develop at all until the late pliocene , but apparently developed very quickly . this had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of plants that once grew on present-day greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming antarctic ice sheet .
