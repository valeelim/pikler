Autopoiesis     autopoiesis refers to life and other self-organising systems . the word means `` self creation or self-production '' . it refers to a system which can reproduce and sustain itself . the term was introduced in 1972 by chilean biologists humberto maturana and francisco varela to define the self-maintaining chemistry of living cells . since then the concept has also been applied to systems theory and sociology . autopoiesis was a modern definition for life , plus any other systems with lifelike properties . to qualify for the name `` autopoiesis '' a system would need to show three main features : 1. the production of their own components 1. the correct assembly of these components 1. continuous repair and maintenance of their own existence . roth commented that `` in short , organisms are self-reproducing and self-maintaining , or 'autopoietic ' , systems '' . this approach makes use of molecular biology ideas and systems science ideas , but it does not refer to the particular way life is organised on earth . this is because the authors thought it was possible for machines to have those features , and for other types of life to exist .
