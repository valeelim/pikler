Lubricant     a lubricant is a substance used to reduce friction between moving surfaces . the property of reducing friction is known as `` lubricity '' ( slipperiness ) . a good lubricant possesses the following characteristics : - does not get affected by temperature or pressure at all - does not burn easily , and may also prevent rusting - high viscosity ( feels like a very thick liquid ) - does not mix with water the most often used lubricant is motor oil , which is used in engines of cars and motorcycles . sometimes , chemicals are added to normal oil to give it special properties . a lubricant , like motor oil , can also help in reducing heat . simply put , cooling depends on surface area in contact . so , if something normally has a small surface area , you can put that thing into a bigger pot , and put oil in the pot . this way , oil comes in contact with small surface area of the small object , and transfers that heat to the big surface area of the big vessel . as a rule , liquids can transfer heat better than gases .
