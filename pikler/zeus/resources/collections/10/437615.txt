Base (geometry)    base ( geometry ) many geometric shapes of more than two dimensions are constructed by using regular two-dimensional shapes . that way a tetrahedron is constructed with four triangles , a cube uses six squares . in that context , the shape that is used for construction is called base . the triangle is the base of the tetrahedron , and the square is the base of the cube . note , that there are geometric figures that use different shapes . a pyramid uses one rectangle and four triangles . in that context , the rectangle is said to be the base of the shape . a cylinder uses a circle or an ellipse as a base .
