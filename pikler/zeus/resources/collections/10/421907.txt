Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg     christian gottfried ehrenberg ( 19 april 1795 â€“ 27 june 1876 ) , german naturalist , zoologist , comparative anatomist , geologist , and microscopist , was one of the most famous and productive scientists of his time . ehrenberg was appointed professor of medicine at berlin university in 1827. in 1829 he accompanied humboldt through eastern russia to the chinese frontier . after his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms , which then were not much studied . for nearly 30 years ehrenberg examined samples of water , soil , sediment , blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new species , among them well-known flagellates such as euglena , ciliates such as `` paramecium aurelia '' and `` paramecium caudatum '' , and many fossils , in nearly 400 scientific publications . he was particularly interested in a unicellular group of protists called diatoms , but he also studied , and named , many species of radiolaria , foraminifera and dinoflagellates . these researches built up our knowledge of the microorganisms of certain geological formations , especially of the chalk , and of the marine and freshwater accumulations . until ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of rock were composed of minute forms of animals or plants . he also demonstrated that the phosphorescence of the sea was due to organisms .
