Land bridge     a land bridge is a term in biogeography . it is a narrow land connection between otherwise separate areas , sometimes called an isthmus . its significance is that animals and plants may cross over it when the sea level is lower . they can not easily cross when the sea level is higher , and water covers the land bridge . the separation of a once connected population often leads to speciation , the splitting of one species into two . there are several causes which affect whether a land bridge is above or below the water . plate tectonics may cause the rise or lowering of land . the causes of general sea level changes are not fully understood , but when sea levels fall , shallow sections of continental shelf may get exposed . sometimes the sea floor rises due to `` post-glacial rebound '' after an ice age . notable examples . - the bering land bridge , which connected asia with north america when the sea level dropped in the ice age , but went under water when the ice melted . - doggerland , a former landmass in the southern north sea which connected the island of great britain to mainland europe during the last ice age
