Eoarchaean     the eoarchaean ( eoarchean ) is the 1st geological era in the archaean that began 4 billion years ago , and ended at 3.6 billion years ago . before it was the hadean it is followed by the palaeoarchaean . the eoarchaean is the earliest period of geology after the solidification of earth 's crust . the abiotic origins of life ( abiogenesis ) have been dated to a time window from 4 to 3.6 billion years ago when atmospheric pressure values ranged from 100 to 10 bar . it was formerly officially unnamed and usually referred to as the first part of the `` early archaean '' ( now an obsolete name ) together with the later palaeoarchaean era . it is the first part of the archaean eon , preceded by the hadean eon . the eoarchaean was followed by the palaeoarchaean era . the name comes from two greek words : `` eos '' ( dawn ) and `` archaios '' ( ancient ) . the 1st supercontinent vaalbara appeared around the end of this period around 3.6 billion years ago . a characteristic of the eoarchean is that earth possessed a firm crust for the first time . however , this crust may have been incomplete at many sites and areas of lava may have existed at the surface . the beginning of the eoarchaean is characterized by heavy asteroid bombardment within the inner solar system : the late heavy bombardment . the eoarchaean is the first phase of our planet from which solid rock formations survived . the largest is the isua greenstone belt at the southwest coast of greenland . it appeared during the eoarchaean around 3.8 billion years ago . the acasta gneiss within the canadian shield have been dated to be 4.03 ga and are therefore the oldest preserved rock formations . in 2008 another rock formation was discovered in the nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt in northern qu√©bec in canada which has been dated to be 4.28 ga. these formations are presently under intense investigation .
