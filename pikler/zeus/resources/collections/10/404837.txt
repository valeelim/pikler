Crest (feathers)    crest ( feathers ) the crest , in some cases called crown , is a group of feathers that some species of birds have on top of the head . the feathers of these crests can move up and down or be permanently up , depending of the species . for example , the crests of cockatoos and the hoopoe could be up or down but the feathers in the crest of the grey crowned crane are always up . crests on birds are generally used for display purposes . birds with crests often use them to communicate with others and as a part of their courtship . they also tend to display their crests when they are frightened or ready to fight because the birds may appear larger of what they really are . cockatoos and their smaller cousins , cockatiels , are part of the cacatuidae family of parrots found in australia , the bismarck archipelago and the philippines , and are probably the most recognizable birds to feature crests . cockatoos and cockatiels possess crests which may be raised or lowered at will . their crests are used to communicate with fellow members of their species , or as a form of defense to frighten away other species that approach too closely , making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised .
