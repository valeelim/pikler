G0 phase     the g phase ( called the g zero phase ) or resting phase is a period in the cell cycle in which cells are inactive . cells enter g phase from g and stop dividing . some cells , such as neurons , remain in g for indefinite period . some cells enter g phase semi-permanently , such as some cells of the liver and kidney . many cells do not enter g and continue to divide throughout an organism 's life , e.g . epithelial cells .
