Environmental economics     environmental economics is a domain of economics that looks at problems of the environment from an economical perspective . natural resources , such as clean water are limited , because of pollution . they are also seen as `` free '' public goods . this means that if there are no rules on how to use these goods , they will be used too much . there are externalities for using these goods , and there is the problem of free riders . in this perspective , the solution is to convert these resources into economic goods , which are integrated in the market . this will lessen the problem of free-riding , and give incentives to use these goods sparingly . an example for this is a tax which is tied to pollution . '' 'proper legislation and observation of property right on how to regulate the use of these public goods is also another important factor in ensuring that market inefficiencies do n't result .
