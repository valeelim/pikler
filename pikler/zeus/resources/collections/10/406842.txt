Laurentia     laurentia ( or north american craton ) is a large continental craton . it forms the ancient geological core of the north american continent . originally , it included core of greenland and the northwestern part of scotland , known as the hebridean terrane . during other times in its past , laurentia has been part of larger continents and supercontinents . it is an assembly of smaller tectonic plates which merged early in the palaeoproterozoic era . as the plates moved together , a huge range of mountains formed . small plates and oceanic islands collided with and fused with the ever-growing laurentia . together they made the huge , stable craton we see today as the north and west of north america and greenland . the remaining , western , part of north america was added much later , after pangaea split up , and the americas moved west from eurasia and gondwana . the craton is named after the laurentian mountains . the cratonic rocks are metamorphic and igneous , while the overlying sedimentary rocks are composed mostly of limestones , sandstones , and shales . these sedimentary rocks were deposited from 650 to 290 million years ago . in eastern and central canada , much of the stable craton is exposed at the surface .
