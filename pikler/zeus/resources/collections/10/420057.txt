Anthroposophy     anthroposophy is a philosophy founded by rudolf steiner . the philosophy teaches that through inner development a person can better know the spiritual world . `` anthropos '' is a greek word that means `` human being '' . `` sophos '' means `` wise '' . steiner believed every human being had the wisdom to understand the mysteries of existence . he left the german theosophical society in 1912 trading divine wisdom for human wisdom . anthroposophy does not have a rigid set of beliefs . it is said to be a philosophy of freedom . each person connects to the world through an individual path . the path to wisdom is based on research . the research leads to knowledge . this is similar to teachings of thomas aquinas . anthroposophy is different in that it pursues knowledge of science , the arts and spirituality all together . the philosophy also teaches respect of other humans . it encourages support of others in their interest and learning of the spiritual world . to support this , steiner created the anthroposophical society in 1923. it is now called the general anthroposophical society . the society has groups and national societies in over 75 countries .
