Pandeism     pandeism is the belief that a higher being like a god made the universe , but made it by becoming it . people who follow pandeism are called pandeists . after making the universe , god and the universe are equivalent ( the same thing . ) because god is now the universe , it can not do things in the universe . pandeists believe that people who want to know about god should rely on logic and reason and not traditions of their religion . pandeists believe that everything that exists is a part of god or that god is a part of everything that exists . the name pandeism comes from the words deism ( a kind of belief in god ) and pan ( all ) . pandeists believe that a higher power became the world . they do not believe that the creation of the universe happened because of a spontaneous event . they reject supernatural events like miracles and believe that god has become the natural laws as well , and does not need to interfere with them . pandeists also see holy books , such as the bible and qur'an , as writings made by people rather than the writings of god . pandeists believe that people are part of god too , and so some people think they see or hear god , when they are really only seeing or hearing the part of god that is in them .
