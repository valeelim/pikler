Leftâ€“right politics     political parties are often described as being either left-wing , right-wing , or center . left-wing parties are more socialist based , so they will tax more , but they offer more government services , such as cheaper or free education , health , etc . a good example of a left-wing country would be norway . the maximum individual tax rate in norway is 47.8 % the minimum being 36 % , but the government provides free education , health care , unemployment benefits , and pension benefits , to name a few . right-wing parties are more corporately based , and allow businesses to have more freedom from government control . they also expect a higher level of self-provision by people . right-wing parties also try to reduce the level of government control over society and community . businesses can get tax breaks , loosened tax rules , and the government also loosens up labor laws , making it easier for businesses to hire and fire people . the two extremes of each side are communism on the extreme left , and fascism on the extreme right .
