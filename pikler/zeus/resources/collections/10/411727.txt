Through-hole technology     through-hole technology is a way to mount electronic components to printed circuit boards ( pcb ) . it involves the use of leads on the components that are inserted into holes drilled in the pcbs and soldered to pads on the opposite side either by manual assembly ( handiwork ) or by the use of automated insertion mount machines . many parts made for through hole mounting are larger than those for surface-mount technology .
