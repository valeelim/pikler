Prima scriptura     in christianity , prima scriptura is the idea that canonical scripture is the most important kind of divine revelation . people who believe in this idea say that revelation that comes from scripture is more important than revelation that comes from other sources . other sources include traditions , spiritual gifts , conscience , common sense and the views of experts . prima scriptura suggests that there are ways of knowing or understanding god and his will that do not originate from canonized scripture . these may be helpful in interpreting that scripture , but that if they seem to contradict the scriptures , the scriptures should be used instead . prima scriptura is sometimes mentioned together with sola scriptura . sola scriptura is a view mainly held by protestants which states that only scripture is the source of divine revelation . sola scriptura rejects scripture which is not in the bible , while prima scriptura says that there may be such scripture .
