Eyespot     an eyespot is a simple light-sensitive organ in biology . it may be called an ocellus , or pigment pit . they are quite common in small , simple invertebrates , such as `` planaria '' . they do not have lenses or any means of focussing . therefore , they can sense light from dark , but do not give the animal a visual scene as our eyes do . in many simple animals the eyespot senses light with a pigment molecule called an opsin . then a nerve fibre goes from the eyespot to the simple nervous system . this allows the animal to move in response to ( for example ) a shadow passing over it . eyespots also occur in single-celled protists like `` euglena '' and `` chlamydomonas '' , where it is connected to the flagellum . this allows the information from the light patch to influence the cells 's movement . the first fossils of eyes that have been found to date are from the early cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . this period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` cambrian explosion '' . one idea is that the evolution of eyes started an arms race which led to a rapid spate of evolution . much earlier than this organisms would have used light spots for light sensitivity , but did not have a visual scene for rapid navigation .
