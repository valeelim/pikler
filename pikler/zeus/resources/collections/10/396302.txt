Dutch Golden Age painting     there was a period in the 17th century , where dutch trade , science and art were among the most advanced in europe . the period is known as the dutch golden age . in general , this period started in the second half of the eighty years ' war . after the war , there was the dutch republic which was the most propsperous nation in europe . the historical period of the time was called baroque . many of the paintings of this period show the scenes more pretty than they really were . this is called 'idealisation ' . the dutch paintings of the time often lack this feature . artists of the movement include peter paul rubens , johannes vermeer , bartholomeus van der helst , and jacob van loo . there were relatively few paintings with religious themes during this period . the reason for this was that most dutch were calvinist . calvinism forbade religious painting in churches . even though such subjects were acceptable in private homes , they were not very popular . the other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present , but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres , sub-divided into numerous specialized categories , such as scenes of peasant life , landscapes , townscapes , landscapes with animals , maritime paintings , flower paintings and still lifes of various types . the development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century dutch artists .
