Cyclomatic complexity     cyclomatic complexity is a measurement to see how difficult a computer program is to understand . the measurement was developed by thomas j. mccabe , sr. in 1976. it looks at the program 's source code and measures the number of independent paths through the source code . the concept is similar to the general text complexity , which is measured by the flesch-kincaid readability test . cyclomatic complexity is computed using the control flow graph of the program : the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program , and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command . cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions , modules , methods or classes within a program . one testing strategy , called basis path testing by mccabe who first proposed it , is to test each linearly independent path through the program ; in this case , the number of test cases will equal the cyclomatic complexity of the program .
