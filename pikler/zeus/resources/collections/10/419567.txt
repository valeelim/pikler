Cerdic of Wessex     cerdic ( 534 ) was the first anglo saxon king of the gewisse , also called the king of wessex . he was the of the kings of wessex and the anglo-saxon kings of england beginning with athelstan . according to the anglo-saxon chronicle , cerdic , along with his son cynric , came to britain in 495. their three ships landed at cerdices ora fought the britons there on the same day . most of what is known about cerdic comes from the anglo-saxon chronicle . in 519 he and his son defeated britons at cerdices ford and took wessex . in 527 at a place called cerdices leaga cerdic and cynric battled with the britons again . in 530 they conquered the isle of wight . the record for 534 states that cerdic died this year . cerdic was succeeded by his son cynric . the anglo-saxon chronicle gave cenred a pedigree going back to the saxon god woden . but historian kenneth sisam showed this was `` borrowed '' from the kings of bernicia and was not historic . but archaeological evidence shows that outside of kent and sussex , the main area of settlement was in the upper thames valley . this agrees with much of the anglo-saxon chronicle although dates are harder to verify .
