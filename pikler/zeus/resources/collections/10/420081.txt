Aurornis     aurornis is a genus of dinobird from later jurassic or the lower cretaceous . it lived in what is now china . `` aurornis xui '' may be the most basal ( `` primitive '' ) bird species known to date . aurornis was discovered in 2013. the animal may predate the famous `` archaeopteryx lithographica '' , the earliest bird , by about 10 million years . `` aurornis '' was described from a sedimentary rock fossil in 2013. the fossil was purchased from a local dealer who said it had been unearthed in yaoluguo in western liaoning , china . at first , analysis confirmed it came from the tiaojishan formation , which has been dated to the late jurassic period , about 160 million years ago . the fossil features traces of downy feathers along the animal 's tail , chest , and neck . it was only partly prepared at the time of purchase ; the feathers were not showing , and the fossil bore no signs of forgery . on 7th june 2013 science ( journal ) said that pascal godefroit , the paleontologist who led the team that described `` aurornis '' , is uncertain if the fossil material came from liaoning province 's 160-million-year-old tiaojishan formation as claimed by the fossil dealer . it may be from the province 's 125-million-year-old yixian formation , which is known to have produced several ancient bird fossils . the failure to secure rigorous provenance casts doubt on the claim that `` aurornis '' is 160 million years old and predates `` archaeopteryx '' . godefroit 's team will try to confirm the specimen 's age by mineralogical and botanical analysis on the shale slab .
