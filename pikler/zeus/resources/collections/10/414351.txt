Ancient woodland     ancient woodland is the term used in the united kingdom for woodland which has existed continuously since 1600 or before in england and wales ( or 1750 in scotland ) . before those dates , planting of new woodland was uncommon , so a wood present in 1600 was likely to have developed naturally . the analogous american term is `` old growth forest '' . for many species of animal and plant , ancient woodland sites provide the only habitat . for many others , conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites . ancient woodland in the uk , like rainforest in the tropics , is home to rare and threatened species , more than any other uk habitat . for these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource , or 'critical natural capital ' . ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by natural england and equivalent bodies . many ancient woodlands have legal protection , but an ancient woodland is not automatically protected . examples . - cannock chase , staffs
