Milliarium     a milliarium ( plural milliaria ) was a stone that was placed alongside roman roads . such stones were used from about the 3rd century bc . they marked the distance between two towns , and were placed at intervals of one roman mile . this was about 1000 milia passum , or . in the celtic provinces , leagues are often used , these are 1500 milia passum , or about . very often the stones condain the following information : - the name of the person or emperor who built or repaired the road , usually with all titles . - the distance between the starting point , and the point where the millarium was placed . some milliaria liste the distance to a larger settlement instead . even if they look like modern road signs showing the distance to given places , this was probably not the first function of these stone pillars . what seems more likely is that they were used to show the power of the person who erected them ; some were probably used for propaganda . very often , the inscription of the emperor was in latin , but the inscription of the distance was in greek . the ordinary population could probably read the second part , but not the first . today between 7.000 and 8.000 such stones are known .
