List of brightest stars     below are the 50 brightest individual stars in order of their `` average '' apparent magnitudes in the visible spectrum as seen from earth . to the naked eye on a clear dark night , in a place far from cities and lights , the total number of stars visible is about 9000. this is not the same as a list of the brightest stars as seen with the naked eye , because close binary or multiple star systems will appear as a single star brighter than their individual components . the binary system rigel kentaurus has an apparent magnitude of -0.27 , but the brightest individual star is alpha centauri a with the apparent magnitude as listed here of -0.01. hence alpha centauri is the third brightest star in the night sky , whilst its brightest component alpha centauri a is the fourth brightest individual star .
