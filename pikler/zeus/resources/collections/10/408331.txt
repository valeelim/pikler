Roberto Clemente     roberto clemente walker ( august 16 , 1934–december 31 , 1972 ) was a puerto rican baseball player . he played 18 seasons in major league baseball ( mlb ) . he played right field for the pittsburgh pirates from 1955 through 1972. clemente 's career was cut short by his death in a plane crash off the coast of his homeland of puerto rico . the flight was planned to deliver emergency supplies to victims of an earthquake in nicaragua . clemente was the first latin american elected to the national baseball hall of fame . he and lou gehrig are the only hall of fame members that did not have the five-year waiting period . however , the rules for election were different in gehrig 's day . he was eligible when he retired in 1939 , and the baseball writers ' association of america ( bbwaa ) , which then as now is the main body for electing players , chose to hold a special election specifically to elect him . ( this was probably because gehrig was known to be dying , and the voters wanted to elect him while he was still alive . ) after clemente 's death , the bbwaa made an exception to its five-year waiting period for clemente . the exception made for clemente is now a rule—a player who dies while active , or within five years of his retirement , becomes eligible for election six months after his death ( provided he has played at least 10 years in major league baseball ) .
