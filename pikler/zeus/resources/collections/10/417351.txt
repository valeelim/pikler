Planets beyond Neptune     the planet neptune was discovered in 1846. after this , many people thought that there might be more planets , which are further away from the sun than neptune . in the early 20th century , percival lowell stated that there must be another planet-like body , farther out than neptune . lowell said that such a planet-like object could explain some irregularities in the orbits of the gas giants , in particular uranus and neptune . the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed uranus enough to explain the irregularities . he called it `` planet x '' . in 1930 , clyde tombaugh discovered pluto . this seemed to validate lowell 's hypothesis . pluto was officially considered the ninth planet until 2006. there was a problem , however : in 1978 , pluto was found to be too small . its gravity would be unable to affect the gas giants . this finding triggered a search for a tenth planet . the spacecraft voyager 2 supplied new measurements in the early 1990s . according to these measurements , pluto was shown to be smaller than first thought . according to a scientific study published at the time , this error could explain the irregularities observed in uranus 's orbit . after the study had been published , the search was largely abandoned . after 1992 , the discovery of many small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than pluto led to a debate over whether pluto should remain a planet , or whether it and its neighbours should , like the asteroids , be given their own separate classification . although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets , in 2006 the international astronomical union reclassified pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets , leaving only eight planets in the solar system . pluto was taken as a model for a dwarf planet .
