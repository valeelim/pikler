Wilson's theorem    wilson 's theorem wilson 's theorem is a theorem of number theory . let `` n '' be any natural number . wilson 's theorem says that `` n '' is a prime number if and only if : this means that if `` n '' is a prime number , the equation is correct . also , if the equation is correct , then `` n '' is a prime number . the equation says that the factorial of `` ( n - 1 ) '' is one less than a multiple of `` n '' .
