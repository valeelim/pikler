Black Eye galaxy     the black eye galaxy ( or sleeping beauty galaxy ; messier 64 , m64 , or ngc 4826 ) was discovered in 1779. it is a fairly close galaxy , just over 24 million light years away . it has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of its bright nucleus . this is why it is called the `` black eye '' or `` evil eye '' galaxy . m64 is well known among amateur astronomers because it can be seen in small telescopes . it is a spiral galaxy in the coma berenices constellation . the gas in the outer areas of m64 rotates in the opposite direction to the gas and stars in the inner areas . the inner area has a radius of only about 3,000 light-years , while the outer area extends another 40,000 light-years many new stars are near the edges between the two areas . astronomers think the oppositely rotating gas happened when m64 took in a galaxy that collided with it . this happened over a billion years ago . new stars are forming in the shear region . the shear region is where the oppositely rotating gases collide , are pushed together , and get smaller .
