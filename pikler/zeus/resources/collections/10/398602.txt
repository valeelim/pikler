Bioturbation     bioturbation is the reworking of soils and sediments by animals or plants . it disturbs and changes sediment . any animal living in the soil or on the bottom under water may disturb the sediment by moving it around . burrowing , eating and defecation of sediment grains , building galleries ( etc . ) all disturb the sediment . common bioturbators include annelids ( `` ringed worms '' ) such as oligochaetes , bivalves like mussels , clams , gastropods , holothurians . fossil sites with bioturbation do not leave traces of soft-bodied animals . in contrast , fossil sites with undisturbed sediment have given rise to important lagerst√§tten with many impressions of small soft-bodied invertebrates .
