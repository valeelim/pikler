Quantum teleportation     quantum teleportation is a way of transferring the quantum state of one quantum system to another using the quantum entanglement between two other systems . for example , let 's assume alice and bob share an entangled pair of particles a and b , and alice wants to teleport the information of another `` message '' particle m to bob . what alice does is interact her half of the entangled pair , a , she shares with bob , so that now the message particle m is entangled with alice 's other particle a. next alice measures both of her particles a and m and tells what the outcomes of these measurements are to bob . because the message particle m was entangled with alice 's other particle a , and bob has the information of alice 's measurements , he can use this information to recreate the original message particle m out of the one he has b. what makes quantum teleportation special is that we did n't need to physically move the message particle m from alice to bob .
