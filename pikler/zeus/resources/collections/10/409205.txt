Fortune Head     fortune head is a headland about from the town of fortune on the burin peninsula , southeastern newfoundland . a thick section of rock along its cliffs is the global boundary stratotype section and point ( gssp ) . it represents the boundary between the precambrian era and the cambrian period , 541 million years ago . because of its accessibility ( easy to get at ) and many fossils , fortune head was selected in 1992 over similar rock sections in siberia , russia , and meischucum , china . fortune head was given full ecological reserve status in 1992 after its selection as the global stratotype . the reserve is in size . the fortune head lighthouse also acts as a visitors center . the burin peninsula is part of the avalon zone of the appalachian orogen , a late precambrian episode of mountain-building . the stratigraphy is not uniform throughout the region , however . the sediments were probably deposited in shoreline environments along the former iapetus ocean . the global stratotype at fortune head is made up of sandstones , siltstones , and limestones . some of these rocks have mud cracks and stromatolites , suggesting that deposition occurred in tidal or , at deepest , continental shelf environments .
