Contrail     a contrail ( condensation trail ) is a cloud-like trail of water vapor or ice crystals left by an airplane . when jet fuel burns , it produces water vapor and carbon dioxide . the water vapor condenses ( turns from gas to liquid ) because of the low temperature at the high altitude that the plane is flying . the chemtrail conspiracy theory claims that these trails may contain harmful chemicals being sprayed by government organizations .
