Cloaking device     a cloaking device or invisibility cloak has long been featured in science fiction . attempts have been made to devise a way to do it with objects , but results were disappointing until now . a paper in `` nature communications '' for september 2013 announces a new approach . from reference 1 , the two `` supplementary movies '' show the successful cloaking of a goldfish and a cat so far as they are within the experimental space . a recent review said these methods were possible : 1. optical camouflage : a modified background image is projected onto a cloak of reflective material ( the kind used to make projector screens ) . the wearer becomes invisible to anyone standing at the projection source . 1. the `` mirage effect '' : electric current is passed through submerged carbon nanotubes to create very high local temperatures . this causes light to bounce off them , hiding objects behind . 1. adaptive heat cloaking : a camera records background temperatures , these are displayed by sheets of hexagonal pixels which change temperature very quickly , camouflaging even moving vehicles from heat-sensitive cameras .
