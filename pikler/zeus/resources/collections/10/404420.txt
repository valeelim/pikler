Sniper team     a sniper team ( or sniper cell ) is made up of one or more snipers and support personnel such as a spotter . members can sometimes fulfill several roles . the spotter helps to closely observe the targets and their surroundings . the sniper fires the shots . sometimes there may be extra members in the team , including someone to secure and the team 's position , and to communicate with other teams . this third member is known as the flanker . the spotter finds , watches , and assigns targets , and also watches to see whether the shot has hit or missed the target . they use a specialised telescope to do this . they also make calculations for distance and angle , and try to read the direction and strength of the wind . this is so that the sniper can make adjustments to the aim to make the shot more accurate . as well as their long-range rifle , a sniper team is usually armed with a shorter-ranged weapon . this is to defend the team in case enemies come in close contact . equally important is remaining hidden from view . teams use camouflage , and choose locations where there is something for them to hide behind .
