Refractory     a refractory is a material that can stand high temperature . it is used in furnaces , kilns , incinerators and reactors . materials to make refractory must be chemically and physically stable at high temperature , such as alumina , silica , magnesia and lime . types of refractory . based on material . - acidic refractory - neutral refractory - basic refractory based on ways to manufacture . - dry press process - fused cast - hand molded - formed - unformed - unformed dry vibratable based on operating temperature . - normal refractory - high refractory - super refractory
