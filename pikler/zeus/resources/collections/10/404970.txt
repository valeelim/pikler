Non-Hodgkin lymphoma     non-hodgkin lymphoma ( which is also known as `` b-cell '' and `` t-cell lymphomas '' ) is a cancer of the lymphatic system . the lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body . it is also part of the immune system . clear fluid called `` lymph '' flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as `` lymphocytes '' . in lymphoma , these lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way . a lot of them appear in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes ( glands ) . the affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making you more vulnerable to infection . the most common symptom of non-hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin . the usual way to know that a person has non-hodgkin lymphoma is to do a biopsy ( testing a sample of affected lymph node tissue ) .
