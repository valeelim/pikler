Division of Bennelong     the division of bennelong is an australian electorate in new south wales . the division was set up in 1949. it is named for bennelong , an indigenous australian man who became a friend of the first governor of new south wales , arthur phillip . bennelong includes the suburbs of eastwood , carlingford , epping and ryde . when the division of bennelong was created in 1949 , it covered mainly the suburbs of ryde , hunters hill and lane cove . these were ( and still are ) richer areas , and bennelong was a `` safe '' liberal seat . over the years bennelong has changed into a marginal seat for two reasons . firstly , the electoral boundary of bennelong has been changed many times , where it has moved west into labor voting areas . rich suburbs like lane cove and hunters hill in the east are no longer included . the division now includes eastwood , epping , carlingford and working class ermington in the north and west . secondly , the type of people living in the division has changed . since the early 1990s , there has been an increase in migrants from china , hong kong , south korea and india . these are wealthy and conservative people who would support the liberal party , but they have not like the liberal policies on immigration and multiculturalism .
