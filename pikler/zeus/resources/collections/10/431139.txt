Nigersaurus     nigersaurus ( meaning `` niger reptile '' ) is a genus of `` diplodocus '' -like sauropod dinosaur . it lived in the middle of the cretaceous period in what is now the republic of niger . fossils of this dinosaur were first described in 1976 , but it was only named in 1999 after more complete remains were found and described . its skull was very different from `` diplodocus '' , suggesting a different feeding method . it had many fenestrae ( openings ) and thin bones . it had a wide muzzle filled with more than 500 teeth . they were replaced often : about every 14 days the whole set were replaced together . the jaws may have had a keratinous sheath , something like a wide beak . its jaws were wider than the skull , and its teeth were placed far to the front . `` nigersaurus '' was long , which is small for a sauropod , and had a short neck . it weighed around 4 tonnes , comparable to a modern elephant . its skeleton was filled with air sacs , which lightened the weight . its limbs were robustly built . `` nigersaurus '' was probably a browser , and fed with its head close to the ground . the region of its brain that detected smell was small , although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs . there has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards , or horizontally like other sauropods . it lived in a riparian habitat ( near rivers ) . its diet probably consisted of soft plants , such as ferns , horsetails , and angiosperms . it is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area , and shared its habitat with other large herbivores , as well as large theropods and crocodylomorphs .
