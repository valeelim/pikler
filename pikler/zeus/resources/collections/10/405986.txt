Tahiti rail     the tahiti rail ( `` gallirallus pacificus '' ) or tahiti red-billed rail is a poorly known extinct species of rail . it once lived on tahiti . the second voyage of james cook in 1773 got one . it was described by johann reinhold forster and painted by his son , georg . the tahitian name was ebōnā or ōmnā . due to a major mix-up with the name , the name `` rallus ecaudatus '' was commonly used in the mid-late 20th century to refer to this bird . this is , however , in error , as the name is a subspecies of the buff-banded rail . today it is known as `` gallirallus philippensis ecaudatus '' . also , at least once , the tahitian bird has been referred to by the scientific name of the samoan wood rail , `` gallinula pacifica '' , in a major scientific work . not much is known about the bird 's extinction . one idea is that the bird might have been prey to other species . the bird 's habitat had active volcanos . sources . - database entry of the bird includes justification for why this species is extinct . - gmelin , johann friedrich ( 1879 ) : [ description of `` gallirallus pacificus '' ] . `` in : systema naturae ( 13th edition ) '' 1 , part 2 : 717 .
