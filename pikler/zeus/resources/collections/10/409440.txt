Memory leak     when a program gets executed , it uses memory . in some cases , a poorely-written program may incorrectly manage the memory that has been given to it . as a consequence , the memory that was actually supposed to be reused after the program has finished its job can not be accessed again . this is known as a memory leak . one of the most common reasons for memory leaks is the program not giving its memory back after it has finished execution . memory leaks may result in several issues such as degradation of performance and systems being unresponsive .
