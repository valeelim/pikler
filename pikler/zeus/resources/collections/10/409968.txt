Shakespeare authorship question     some people say that some of the works attributed to william shakespeare of stratford-upon-avon were not actually written by him . the scientific argument behind this claim is known as the shakespeare authorship question . `` anti-stratfordians '' say shakespeare of stratford was a false name to shield the identity of the real author or authors . these authors did not want their real names to become public , for various resons . although the idea has attracted much public interest , all but a few shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and for the most part acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims . shakespeare 's authorship was first questioned in the middle of the 19th century . at that time the idea that shakespeare was the greatest writer of all time had become widespread . shakespeare had a simple background , and some details of his life are unknown . these facts seemed to be incompatible with his poetic eminence and his reputation for genius . some people suspected that shakespeare might not have written the works attributed to him . the controversy has since spawned a vast body of literature , and 80 authorship candidates have been proposed , including francis bacon , the 6th earl of derby , christopher marlowe , and the 17th earl of oxford .
