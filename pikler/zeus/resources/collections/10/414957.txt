Steatorrhea     steatorrhea means excess undigested fat in feces . in this case , the feces is often lighter , sometimes whitish , in color . it produces a fouler-than-usual , sour-rancid smell , and floats on the surface of the water as opposed to sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl . steatorrhea is caused by the inability to digest and absorb fat in the diet . it may be helped in some cases by taking enzymes , such as those usually produced by the body , which digest fat . research should be done , and a doctor consulted if necessary , to determine the cause of the inability to digest and absorb fat . the causes range from mild to very severe and life-threatenting , so simply treating symptoms may not be enough .
