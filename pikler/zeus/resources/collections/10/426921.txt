Battle of Hatfield Chase     the battle of hatfield chase was fought on 12 october 633 at hatfield chase near doncaster in present-day yorkshire . the pagan king penda of mercia and the christian king of gynedd , cadwallon ap cadfan joined forces to attack northumbria . king edwin met them in the southern part of his kingdom . in the battle edwin was killed and his army was defeated . cadwallon destroyed as much of northumbria as he could . this led to the end of northumbrian dominance over southern england for a short time . edwin of northumbria ( ruled 616â€“633 ) was recognized as overlord over all of britain . in his wars he conquered the kingdom of elmet ( western yorkshire ) . he then drove out its king , cerdic . this gave him access all the way to the irish sea . elmet was one of the last kingdoms of the britons . he next moved against wales when he invaded the welsh north and captured anglesey . he drove cadwallon to the far eastern part of the island and laid siege to him at priestholme . this caused cadwallon , a christian king , to ally himself with penda , the pagan king of mercia . cadwallon 's motive was revenge on the powerful northumbrian ruler who had invaded his kingdom . penda resented northumbria 's being christianized by kent . he also wanted edwin 's power over the other kingdoms .
