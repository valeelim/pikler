Ecgfrith of Mercia     ecgfrith ( 796 ) was the king of mercia from july to december 796. he was the son of offa , the king of mercia , and cynethryth . in 787 he was crowned king of mercia while his father still ruled . this is the first known consecration of an english king . no doubt it was offs 's imitation of the consecration of charlemagne 's sons by the pope in 781. it was a practical way to recognize ecgfrith as heir to the mercian kingdom . offa continued to rule and maintained all the power himself . ecgfrith was succeeded as king by coenwulf . this was probably because offa had arranged the murder of nearer relatives in order to eliminate any rivals to ecgfrith . alcuin of york , an english deacon and scholar wrote : when his father died in july of 796 ecgfrith was king for only 141 days . the cause of his death is unknown but may not have been natural . < br >
