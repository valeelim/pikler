Epte     the epte is a river in seine-maritime and eure , in normandy , france . it is a tributary of the river seine . it begins in seine-maritime department in the pays de bray , near forges-les-eaux . the river empties into the seine not far from giverny . in 911 the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte established the river as the historical boundary between normandy and île-de-france . this divided the traditional county of the vexin into two parts . the norman vexin became a part of normandy while the french vexin remained a part of the île-de-france . a series of castles were built on both banks of the epte to guard this frontier . claude monet lived at giverny near the river for more than forty years . in his garden , by diverting a branch of the epte , he established a water garden with its famous water-lily pond and a japanese-style bridge . the river appears in several of his works , including `` peupliers au bord de l'epte '' ( poplars on the banks of the epte ) . other websites . - http : //www.geoportail.fr
