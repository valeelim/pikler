Raindrop Prelude     the prelude op . 28 , no . 15 , by frédéric chopin is known as the `` raindrop '' prelude . it is one of the 24 chopin preludes . this is the longest of the preludes . it lasts between five and seven minutes . the prelude is famous for its repeating a-flat . this note appears throughout the piece . it sounds like raindrops to many listeners . it is known for it 's repetitive raindrop motif . some of the preludes were written during chopin and george sand 's stay at a monastery in valldemossa , majorca in 1838. in her `` histoire de ma vie '' , sand told how one evening she and her son maurice , returning from palma , majorca , in a terrible rainstorm , found a frantic chopin who cried , `` ah ! i knew well that you were dead . '' while playing his piano he had a dream : `` he saw himself drowned in a lake . heavy drops of icy water fell in a regular rhythm on his breast , and when i made him listen to the sound of the drops of water indeed falling in rhythm on the roof , he denied having heard it . he was even angry that i should interpret this in terms of imitative sounds . he protested with all his might – and he was right to – against the childishness of such aural imitations . his genius was filled with the mysterious sounds of nature , but transformed into sublime equivalents in musical thought , and not through slavish imitation of the actual external sounds .
