Linear predictor function     in statistics and in machine learning , a linear predictor function is a linear function ( linear combination ) of a set of coefficients and explanatory variables ( independent variables ) , whose value is used to predict the outcome of a dependent variable . functions of this sort are standard in linear regression , where the coefficients are termed regression coefficients . however , they also occur in various types of linear classifiers ( e.g . logistic regression , perceptrons , support vector machines , and linear discriminant analysis ) , as well as in various other models , such as principal component analysis and factor analysis . in many of these models , the coefficients are referred to as `` weights '' .
