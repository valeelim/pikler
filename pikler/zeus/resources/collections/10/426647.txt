Tribal Hidage     the tribal hidage is generally considered to be a list dated to 7th or 8th century anglo-saxon england . it was a list of 35 tribes that made up the majority of the peoples living in southern england at that time . each tribe or kingdom on the list had a rounded off number of hides ( units of land measurement ) . modern historians believe it was created by either mercian or northumbrian overlords to collect tribute from the other groups . the tribal hidage is an important historical document . the oldest copies available were written in style of the 11th century . this is at a time when many of the names of the earlier regions had been forgotten . in some cases the list is the only evidence that a region or people of that name ever existed . there were probably older versions of the tribal hidage and may have dated back to when penda of mercia dominated anglo-saxon england ( 642–655 ) . historians are mixed when it comes to where the document came from originally . it may have been written by paulinus for king edwin of northumbria . it may have been created for the use of offa of mercia . others have not suggested a place or reign , but a particular period of time for when it was probably written—between 670-690. historians are not certain what the exact reason was for creating the list . most seem to agree it was probably a tribute list . there are signs that the list was updated over a period of time . so it may have had more than one purpose .
