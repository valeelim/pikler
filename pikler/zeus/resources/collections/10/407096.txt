Diophantine equation     a diophantine equation is an equation that only takes integer coefficients , and that can be written as formula_1 , where `` f '' is a polynomial . diophantine analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis , concerned with such equations . typical questions include : 1. are there any solutions ? 1. are there any solutions beyond some that are easily found by inspection ? 1. are there finitely or infinitely many solutions ? 1. can all solutions be found in theory ? 1. can one in practice compute a full list of solutions ? very often such problems were unresolved for centuries . with time , mathematicians came to understand their depth ( in some cases ) , rather than treat them as puzzles . the equation is named after diophantus of alexandria , a mathematician , who described them first . the restriction on integer coefficients makes sense , when one is concerned about finding divisors , or in the case of modular arithmetic . in everyday life , many equations solve problems where only whole numbers make sense : a product is composed of many parts , but only whole pieces can be produced .
