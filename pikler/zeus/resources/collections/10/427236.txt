Power system harmonics     power system harmonics are the harmonic contents from the utility frequency . harmonics are one kind of distortion to a voltage or current 's waveform . this distortion is produced by non-linear devices connected to the power system . since equipment is made to work at the utility frequency , harmonics can make it work wrong . this one kind of power quality problem . it increases heating in power equipment . harmonics can be eliminated or reduced by using harmonic filter .
