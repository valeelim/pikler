Paradox of thrift     the paradox of thrift is the idea that during a recession , people will want to save more money . but if everyone saves money , then the economy can slow down even more , reducing peoples ' income as a result . it is often linked with john maynard keynes . it is a main theory of keynesian economics . it is a kind of prisoner 's dilemma : saving benefits each individual but damages the general population . this is a paradox because it is contrary to intuition . someone might think that what seems to be good for an individual in the economy will be good for the entire population . however , exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a `` rainy day '' , and yet not be good for the economy as a whole . there is little agreement as to how important this is in a modern economy . modern economies are huge , and much affected by other national economies .
