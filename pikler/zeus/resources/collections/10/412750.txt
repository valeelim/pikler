Linear independence     linear independence is a concept from linear algebra . it is used to talk about vector spaces . each vector space has a null vector . this vector is expressed as a linear combination ( a sum ) of other vectors . a set of these vectors is called `` linearly independent '' if and only if all of them are needed to express this null vector . this is equivalent to saying that at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others . if the vectors are not linearly independent , they are called `` linearly dependent '' . as an example , take the three-dimensional euclidean space : here the first three vectors are linearly independent ; but the fourth vector equals nine times the first plus five times the second plus four times the third , so the four vectors together are linearly dependent . linear dependence is a property of the family , not of any particular vector ; for example in this case we could just as well write the first vector as a linear combination of the last three .
