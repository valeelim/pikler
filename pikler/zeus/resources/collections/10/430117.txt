Gyrwas     gyrwas ( also called gyrwe ) was the name of an early anglo-saxon people . they lived mainly on the western edge of the grassy wetlands called the fens in eastern england . they were divided into two tribal groups ; the northern gyrwas and the southern gyrwas . this is how they were recorded in the tribal hidage . the name gyrwe means 'fen-dweller ' . the territory of the gyrwas included lindisfarne , hatfield , nottinghamshire , northern cambridgeshire , huntingdonshire , and as far south as peterborough in northamptonshire . the area around jarrow was in their territory as well . the fens supplied the gyrwas with fish and but they lived on the drier lands and islands nearby . the gyrwas had their own leaders as late as the first half of the 7th century . bede records a tondbert , `` priceps '' of the south gyrwas . he asked for the hand in marriage of etheldreda , the daughter of king anna of east anglia . tondbert died shortly after the wedding and ethelreda was then given in marriage to ecgfrith of northumbria . and leaders of tribes like the gyrwas probably did not claim descent from ancient germanic gods , as many kings of the did . but they were of high enough status to marry anglo-saxon royalty .
