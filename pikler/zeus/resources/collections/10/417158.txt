Thematic map     a thematic map is a kind of map . different from normal maps , a thematic map is designed to show the distribution of human or natural features or data . the information may or may not be related to geography . for example , a map which shows population is a thematic map . thematic maps are called so because they show features relating to a particular theme or aspect of geography . an early contributor to thematic mapping in england was the english astronomer edmond halley ( 1656–1742 ) . his first important map was a star chart of the constellations of the southern hemisphere , published in 1686. in the same year he also published something new , a map of the globe ( earth ) in an article about trade winds . this map is sometimes called the first weather map . another example of early thematic mapping comes from london physician john snow . snow ’ s cholera map of 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis of data . his method anticipates the principles of a geographic information system ( gis ) . he started with an accurate map of a london neighbourhood which included streets and water pump locations . onto this snow placed a dot for each cholera death . the pattern centered around one particular pump on broad street . at snow ’ s request , the handle of the pump was removed , and new cholera cases ceased almost at once . further investigation of the area revealed the broad street pump was near a cesspit under the home of the outbreak 's first cholera victim .
