Black Friday     black friday is the day after thanksgiving in the united states . even though it falls on a friday , which is the last day before the weekend , and comes right after thanksgiving thursday , it is not a federal holiday . there are some states , however , that observe this day instead of columbus day for workers of the state government . the name `` black friday '' started to be used sometime after world war ii , but it was not popular outside of philadelphia until around 1975. many americans see black friday seen as the official beginning of the christmas holiday season , a time when many people go shopping for gifts to give to their family and friends on christmas day . on black friday , many stores have big sales , and it is common to see long lines of people waiting outside stores and in malls to get the best deals first before they run out . because of this , stores usually open around 6 am in the morning or later . some stores , though , started opening at 5 am and even 4 am in the late 20th century . now , a few stores even open at midnight . shoppers like to stay out all day to get what they need , making black friday the busiest shopping day of the year .
