Wartburg Castle     the wartburg is a castle on a 1230-foot ( 410-m ) cliff to the southwest of eisenach , in the state of thuringia , germany . in 1999 unesco added wartburg castle to the world heritage list as an `` outstanding monument of the feudal period in central europe '' because of its `` cultural values of universal significance '' . the castle 's foundation was laid in about 1068 by the thuringian count of schauenburg , louis the springer . he was a relative of the counts of rieneck in franconia . together with its larger sister castle neuenberg in the present-day town of freyburg , the wartburg protected the borders of his territories . the castle ( `` burg '' in german ) reportedly got its name when its founder first saw the hill where the castle now sits ; he is supposed to have said , `` warte , berg -- du sollst mir eine burg tragen ! '' ( `` wait , mountain -- you shall bear a castle for me ! '' ) . it is a german play on words for mountain ( `` berg '' ) and fortress ( `` burg '' ) . the wartburg remained the seat of the thuringian landgraves until 1440 , and around 1207 it became the place of the `` sängerkrieg '' , or minstrels ' contest . later , richard wagner wrote the opera tannhäuser about the contest .
