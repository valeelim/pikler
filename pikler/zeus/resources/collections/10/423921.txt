Jabberwocky     jabberwocky is a 'nonsense poem ' written by lewis carroll in his 1871 novel `` through the looking-glass '' . all the same , it does strangely make a kind of sense . in an early scene alice in wonderland finds the verse `` jabberwocky '' . she says ( p24 ) `` somehow it seems to fill my head with ideasonly i do n't exactly know what they are '' . this is now thought to be one of the greatest nonsense poems written in english . its playful , whimsical language has given us nonsense words and neologisms such as `` galumphing '' and `` chortle '' . the concept of nonsense verse was not original to carroll . nonsense existed in shakespeare 's work and was well known in the brothers grimm 's fairytales , some of which are called lying tales or `` lügenmärchen '' . john tenniel reluctantly agreed to illustrate the book in 1871 , and his illustrations are still the defining images of the poem . the illustration of the jabberwock may reflect the victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of palaeontology and geology . the works of darwin and the models of dinosaurs at the crystal palace exhibition helped feed the interest . perhaps it is not so surprising that tenniel gave the jabberwock `` the leathery wings of a pterodactyl and the long scaly neck and tail of a sauropod '' .
