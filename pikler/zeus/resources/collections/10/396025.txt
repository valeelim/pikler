Trams in Biel     there was a tram system in biel , switzerland , from 1877 to 1948. as the idea of having trams was not popular , there was only one route from bözingen to nidau . the tram was originally a horse carriage on rails . there were only a few carriages from other tram systems . although it was very small there were summer and winter carriages . after biel city bought the system in 1901 , it became electrical with more carriages and a bigger route . the tram was not very popular and the owner did not earn much money . this was the reason why only very few routes were built . all the four routes started at the train station in biel , today known as ‘ zentralplatz ’ . the tram to meinisberg went through mett but because there was a big distance between biel and meinisberg , there were only a few stations . biel city started to reduced the system in 1930. first , route 1 and 2 became route 1. then , in 1940 , routes 2 and 3 were replaced by buses and finally , route 1 became a bus route , too . biel has a well-organized bus system since 1948. it grew more and more and is quite large , with over 15 different routes today . some of them use the old tram routes but more were added , especially in the last 20 years . there are also different bus types today . some are electrical , others run on fuel .
