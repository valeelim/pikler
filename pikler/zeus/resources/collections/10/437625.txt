History of technology     the history of technology is the history of the invention of tools and techniques , and is similar in many ways to the history of humanity . people make new things and , conversely , many scientific endeavors are possible through technologies . technology lets us travel to places we could not otherwise go , and probe the nature of the universe in more detail than our natural senses allow . technological artifacts are products of an economy , a force for economic growth , and a large part of everyday life . technological innovations affect , and are affected by , a society 's cultural traditions . they also are a means to develop and project military power . what are the great technologies ? - the hand axe : used for about 1.5 million years , from `` homo erectus '' to neolithic man . basically a tool for butchering large animals which were probably killed by wooden spears . not for nothing did a curator at the british museum use the phrase `` man the toolmaker '' . - fire , which would have occurred naturally in the drier environments of the savannah . the date of the first deliberate use of fire for warmth , protection and cooking is not known .
