John Davis (sealer)    john davis ( sealer ) john davis ( born in 1784 in surrey ) was an american ship captain from new haven , connecticut . he is thought to have been the first to land on antarctica . he is one of four explorers who share this claim . in february 1821 he may have landed a boat at hughes bay . the davis strait which separates baffin bay from the labrador sea was named by william baffin in 1916. he probably named it after john davis . on march 20 , 1820 , davis left new haven , connecticut for a trip to the pacific ocean . he had received news of the discovery of the south shetland islands while he was anchored at the falkland islands . learning there were large numbers of seals there , he and another ship captain sailed their vessels to greenwich island . but it was too late in the season and other were there before them . so davis took his ship , named `` cecilia '' , in search of seals further south . finding many seals at low island he continued southwards . he probably came upon hughes bay on the antarctic peninsula . his ship 's log records he found `` a large body of land . '' he sent a boat to shore to look for seals but found none . he also wrote `` i think this southern land to be a continent '' . he also wrote in the log the latitude was 64Â°01 's ( sixty-four degrees , one minute , south ) . davis continued his journey back to greenwich island arriving there on 10 february , 1821. he wintered at the falkland islands and returned to seal hunting the following season . it remains impossible , however , to prove he was the first to reach antarctica .
