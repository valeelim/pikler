Cherokee mythology     the native american cherokee people of the appalachians have a complex set of spiritual beliefs . their mythology involves a set of totemic creation spirits who are said to have formed the world . the cherokee believe that signs , visions , dreams and powers were all gifts of the spirits . they believe that the real world is intertwined with and presided over by the spirit world . the creation myth of the cherokee describes the earth as a great floating island surrounded by an ocean . it hangs from the sky by cords attached at the four cardinal points . the story tells that the first earth came to be when dâyuni'sï , the little water beetle , came down from the sky world ( gälûñ'lätï ) to see what was below the water . he paddled over the surface of the water , but found no place to rest . he dived to the bottom of the water and brought up some soft mud . this mud expanded in every direction and became the earth . the other spirits in gälûñ'lätï were eager to come down to the new earth . firstly , birds were sent to see if the mud was dry . the buzzard was sent ahead to make preparations for the others , but the earth was still soft . when he grew tired , his wings dipped very low and brushed the soft mud , forming mountains and valleys in the flat ground . when the earth was finally dry , all of the animals came down from the sky . it was dark , so they took the sun and put it in a track to travel east to west . at first , they set it too low and the crawfish was burned . so they elevated the sun several times to reduce its heat .
