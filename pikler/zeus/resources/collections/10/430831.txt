Scorpius–Centaurus Association     the scorpius–centaurus association ( sometimes called sco–cen or sco ob2 ) is a group of stars near the sun . they are 380 to 470 light years away . they are young stars which all formed from the same cloud of material . they range from 11 to 15 million years old . they include the massive antares , and most of the stars in the southern cross . the sco–cen ob association is the main part of a large complex of recent ( < 20 million years ) and ongoing star-formation . the complex contains several star-forming molecular clouds in sco–cen 's immediate vicinity . the stellar members of the sco–cen association have nearly parallel velocity vectors , moving at about 20 km/s with respect to the sun . the variation of velocity within the subgroups is about 1–2 km/s , and the group is most likely gravitationally unbound . several supernovae have exploded in sco–cen over the past 15 million years , leaving a network of expanding gas superbubbles around the group . to explain the presence of radioactive fe in earth 's deep ocean ferromanganese crust , it has been suggested that a nearby supernova , perhaps a member of sco–cen , exploded in the sun 's vicinity about 3 million years ago .
