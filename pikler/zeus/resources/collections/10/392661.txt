Wolf–Rayet star     wolf–rayet stars ( wr stars ) are evolved , massive stars ( over 20 solar masses initially ) . they are losing mass rapidly by means of a very strong stellar wind , with speeds up to 2000 km/s . while our own sun loses about 10 solar masses every year , wolf–rayet stars typically lose 10 solar masses a year . wolf–rayet stars are extremely hot , with surface temperatures in the range of 30,000 k to around 200,000 k. they are also highly luminous , from tens of thousands to several million times the bolometric luminosity of the sun , although not exceptionally bright visually since most of their output is in far ultraviolet and even `` soft '' x-rays . in astronomy , luminosity is not quite the same thing as brightness . luminosity measures the total amount of energy emitted < /u/l > by a star or other astronomical object in si units of joules per second , which are watts . a watt is one unit of power , and just as a light bulb is measured in watts , so is the sun , which has a total power output of 3.846×10 w. this number is the basic metric used in astronomy : it is known as 1 solar luminosity , the symbol for which is formula_1 .
