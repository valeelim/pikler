Alloy wheels     alloy wheels are automobile wheels that are made of an aluminum alloy instead of steel . most new cars have alloy wheels , although steel wheels are still available on some cars ( usually lower-priced or base-model cars ) . the first alloy wheels were made of magnesium alloys , but these are no longer made because the magnesium alloys were too weak and would eventually crack .
