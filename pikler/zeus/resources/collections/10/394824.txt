Abdominal compartment syndrome     abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity ( compartment ) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within . this may be caused by internal bleeding , a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines , or 'ascites ' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen ( peritoneum ) and the abdominal organs ( the stomach , small and large intestines , pancreas , liver , and gallbladder ) . this increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand , stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs , which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them . when the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen , ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure . an operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed , where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity . the incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen .
