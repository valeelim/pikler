Waltz (music)    waltz ( music ) waltz music is written in 3/4 time ( three beats per bar ) . the music is both dance music and art music . the strauss family were perhaps the most famous of all waltz composers : notably johann strauss i , and johann strauss ii the composer of the famous `` the blue danube '' . waltzes typically have one chord per measure , and the accompaniment style particularly associated with the waltz is ( as seen in the example to the right ) to play the root of the chord on the first beat , the upper notes on the second and third beats . the origins of the dance are in late 18th century germany , probably from a folk dance called the `` lander '' . today the music is danced in two forms , the viennese waltz and the english or slow waltz ( now often called the international waltz ) . the choreography of these modern forms is different from the original dance . there are also a number of ballets which feature waltz music .
