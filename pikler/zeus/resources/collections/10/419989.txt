Isotopes of hydrogen     hydrogen has three main isotopes ; protium ( h ) , deuterium ( h ) and tritium ( h ) . these isotopes form naturally in nature . protium and deuterium are stable . tritium is radioactive and has a half-life of about 12 years . scientists have created four other hydrogen isotopes ( h to h ) , but these isotopes are very unstable and do not exist naturally . the main isotopes of hydrogen are unique because they are the only isotopes that has a name . these names are still in use today . deuterium and tritium sometimes get their own symbols , d and t. however , the international union of pure and applied chemistry does not like these names very much , even though they are often used . there are other isotopes that had their own names when scientists studied radioactivity . but , their names are no longer used today . protium is the most common isotope of hydrogen . it makes up more than 99.98 % of all the hydrogen in the universe . it is named `` protium '' because its nucleus only has one proton . protium has an atomic mass of 1.00782504 ( 7 ) u. the symbol for protium is h .
