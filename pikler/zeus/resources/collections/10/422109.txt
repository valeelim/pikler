Dry thunderstorm     a dry thunderstorm is a type of thunderstorm where there is lightning and thunder , but most or all of the precipitation does not reach the ground . they usually happen in deserts or areas with low water vapor . because dry air usually absorbs liquid water , the rain is absorbed before it reaches the ground . they happen a lot during the summer months in western north america . dry thunderstorms are dangerous because they can cause dust storms and wildfires . dust storms can happen because the dry soil and sand are picked up by strong winds . wildfires can happen because the lightning can hit trees and there is no rain to put out the fires .
