Blocking (stage)    blocking ( stage ) in theatre , blocking is the exact positioning of actors on a stage during a performance . the word comes from practices used by theatre directors of the 19th century , who worked out the staging of a scene on a model stage using wooden blocks to represent each of the actors . today , the director usually determines blocking during rehearsal . they tell the actors where they should move for the proper dramatic and lighting effect , and to ensure that the audience can see everything . the stage itself has been given named areas to help blocking . - the back of the stage is considered up-stage . - the front of the stage is down-stage . - stage left and right refer to the actor 's left and right facing the audience . because this is sometimes misunderstood , the terms `` prompt '' ( actor 's or stage left ) and `` bastard/opposite prompt '' ( actor 's or stage right ) are also used . - house left and house right refer to how the audience sees the stage . the audience 's left is called `` house left '' , and the audience 's right is called `` house right '' .
