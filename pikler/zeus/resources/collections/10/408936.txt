Bo (dog)    bo ( dog ) bo ( born october 9 , 2008 ) is a pet dog of the obama family , the former first family of the united states . bo is a neutered male portuguese water dog . barack obama and his family were given the dog as a gift after months of speculation about the breed and identity of their future pet . the final choice was made partly because malia obama 's allergies made a hypoallergenic breed necessary . bo was occasionally given the title `` first dog of the united states of america '' . in august 2013 , bo was joined by sunny , a female dog of the same breed . the obamas originally wanted to adopt a dog from an animal shelter , but made no promises . in the summer of 2008 , best friends animal society , an animal welfare organization , gathered 50,000 signatures on a petition asking the family to adopt a shelter animal . bo is a gift through a breeder and is not a shelter dog . dog expert cesar milan said bo was part of a larger group known as `` rescue dogs '' . he was unsuccessful in his first home when plans for him to be friends with an older female dog did not go well . the obamas pledged a donation to the dc humane society in a show of support for shelter dogs .
