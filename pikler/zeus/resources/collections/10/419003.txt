Foreign relations of Bangladesh     the foreign relations of bangladesh are the bangladeshi government 's policies in its relations with other countries . since independence in 1971 , bangladesh has officially followed a principle of being friendly with all nations and not being enemies with any . as a member of the non-aligned movement , bangladesh has tended to not take sides with major powers . since the end of the cold war , the country has pursued better relations with its neighbours . it has strong relations with other muslim countries . it does not recognise israel . myanmar is bangladesh 's eastern neighbour . bilateral ties with myanmar are generally good , but some tensions exist between the two countries . this is due to border disputes and the presence of over 270,000 rohingya muslim refugees in bangladesh from mainly-buddhist myanmar . as a result of bilateral discussions , and with the cooperation and assistance of the unhcr , most of the rohingya refugees have now returned to burma . as of 2000 , about 22,000 refugees remain in camps in southern bangladesh .
