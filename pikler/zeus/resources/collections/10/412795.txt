Tyndall effect     the tyndall effect is when light is scattered by particles of matter in its path . it makes a beam of light visible by lighting the particles . under the tyndall effect , the longer-wavelength light is more transmitted while the shorter-wavelength light is more reflected by scattering . in effect , blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light . the blue of a clear sky , and the blue of blue eyes is caused by the tyndall effect , not by a pigment .
