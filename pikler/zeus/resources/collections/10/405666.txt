Gram-positive     gram-positive bacteria are those that are stained dark blue or violet by gram staining . this is in contrast to gram-negative bacteria , which can not hold the `` crystal violet '' stain . instead they take up the counterstain ( `` safranin '' or `` fuchsine '' ) and appear red or pink . the difference is caused by the cell wall structure . gram-positive organisms have thick peptidoglycan layer . this protects them , so they do not need rigid cell walls . on the other hand , gram-negative bacteria have thin , insignificant peptidoglycan layers , so they do need rigid cell walls for support and protection . related pages . - gram-negative - gram staining other websites . - 3d structures of proteins associated with plasma membrane of gram-positive bacteria - 3d structures of proteins associated with outer membrane of gram-positive bacteria - gram staining procedure and images
