Seymour Benzer     seymour benzer ( october 15 , 1921 – november 30 , 2007 ) was an american physicist , biologist and geneticist . his career began during the molecular biology revolution of the 1950s , and he eventually rose to prominence in the fields of molecular and behavioral genetics . he led a genetics research lab at purdue university and at the california institute of technology . benzer made fundamental discoveries in two quite different fields of genetics . he got his phd in solid-state physics , but soon switched to genetics after he read erwin schrödinger 's book `` what is life ? '' at purdue university , benzer developed the `` t4 rii system '' , a new genetic technique . this used recombination in t4 bacteriophage rii mutants to map the inside structure of genes . benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains , he could make a detailed map of the gene , much as alfred sturtevant had done for chromosomes . taking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rii mutant system , benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 rii mutations . the data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity , as previously believed , and that genes were linear . based on his rii data , benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions , point mutations , missense mutations , and nonsense mutations .
