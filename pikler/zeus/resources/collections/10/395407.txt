Mars in fiction     novels and short stories about mars have been popular for over a hundred years . the planet 's dramatic red color that some people can see is one reason for this . another is that the planet is close to earth . also , it looks somewhat like earth . there are also stories about creatures from mars on earth and elsewhere . near the end of the 19th century , the astronomer giovanni schiaparelli reported seeing what he thought might be water channels on mars . because the italian for channels is `` canali '' , english translations tended to render the word as `` canals '' , implying artificial construction . this led to the idea of intelligent beings on mars before it apparently dried up . the following works of fiction deal with the planet itself , with any assumed martian civilization as part of its planetary landscape . several early modern writers , including athanasius kircher and emanuel swedenborg , hypothesized contact with mars . early science fiction about mars often involved the first voyages to the planet , sometimes as an invasion force , more often for the purposes of exploration .
