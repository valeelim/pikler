Economic liberalization     economic liberalization is a theory about applying the ideas of classical liberalism to the government of a state : in very broad terms , it is about removing as much state control as possible from the economy . the state that follows this path often delegates some of the tasks it usually perfomed to privately held companies . liberalization is also about offering interesting taxes to companies . - the state can introduce competition in an economic sector while still maintaining contorl over a publicly held company . this is the case with many railway systems , for example in france - the state can privatize a publicly held company , and guarantee a monopoly on the services it offers : this has been the case with the ocmpany responsible for transporting electricity in france , called réseau de transport d'électricité ( rte ) . it is a subsidiary of électricité de france ( edf ) .
