High-voltage direct current     a high-voltage direct current ( hvdc ) is a transmission system which uses direct electric current ( dc ) to transmit electricity . it is more efficient over long distances distances than the usual high-voltage alternating current ( hvac ) . hvdc was first demonstrated in 1882 in germany . the technology was further developed during the 1930s in sweden and nazi germany . early commercial uses were in the soviet union and sweden in 1951. the converter in hvdc system converts ac electricity to dc electricity or vice versa . converting ac to dc , it acts as a rectifier . converting dc to ac , it acts as an inverter . types of hvdc converters : - line-commutated converters ( lcc ) - voltage-source converters ( vsc ) the transformer at the converter station ensures that the station is isolated from the ac system connected to the hvdc system . it also provides the correct voltage level which will be converted to dc voltage . because harmonics are always produced in electronic equipment , harmonic filters are used at the ac terminal of the converter . the dc harmonic filters can also be used at the dc line after the ac/dc conversion .
