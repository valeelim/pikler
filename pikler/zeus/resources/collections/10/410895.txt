Separatism     in a society , certain people may have ideas that are noticeably different from those of the majority . these people are sometimes called separatists , and their movement is called separatism . very often , separatists demand that the majority ( for example , the state or a religious group ) recognises that their ideas are different . very often , they also want autonomy , self-determination , and perhaps secession and independence from the main group . people may support separatism because they are of a different culture , ethnicity , religion , race or gender than the majority . it may also be because they have different ideas about governing , laws or religion . ethnic separatism is based more on differences in culture and language than religious or racial differences . these may also may exist , however . - czechoslovakia split into the czech republic and slovakia - south ossetia and abkhazia separated from georgia . - armenian separatists of nagorno-karabakh in azerbaijan . religious separatist groups and sects want to withdraw from some larger religious groups .
