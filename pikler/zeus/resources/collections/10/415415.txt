Motivation     motivation is an important part of human psychology . motivation makes a person want to work towards a goal . it makes people want to take action . for example , hunger is a motivation which causes a desire to eat . motivation is the purpose or psychological cause of an action . with animals , motivation is caused by basic needs . these needs can be the needs for food , water , warmth , safety , mating , protecting the young , defending territory , or needs to escape pain and threats . the drive to do these things is instinctive , inborn , and triggered by the situation an animal is in . compared to other animals , motivation in humans is more complicated . like other animals , humans also have the instinct to find food and water and avoid pain . however , humans are also capable of having long-term plans that require motivation over a long period of time . a drive or desire is `` a deficiency or need that activates behaviour aimed at a goal or an incentive '' . < ref name=drive/desire > < /ref > drives may arise inside or outside an organism . external drives for humans are rewards and punishments , and can be quite subtle : a frown or a smile may be sufficient for a young person .
