Trance     trance describes a state of mind . a trance is when a person is conscious , and not sleeping , but is unaware of what is happening around him or her . the term `` trance '' is associated with hypnosis , meditation , magic , flow , religion , and certain kinds of music . it is an `` altered state of consciousness '' . there are many efforts to define what a trance is . some think it is a borderland between normal consciousness and spirituality the most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized , they are in a trance . conscious , and responding to the hypnotist , the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information . another common example is the day-dream , where a person 's mind drifts across private thoughts . everyone daydreams , but young children constantly daydream , and have vivid imaginary fantasies . this is entirely normal . in the language of psychology , this kind of temporary separation from one 's surroundings is called `` dissociation '' . research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream .
