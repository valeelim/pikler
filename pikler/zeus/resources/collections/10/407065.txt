Parasitic wasp     by far the greater number of wasps ( over 100,000 species ) are a special type of parasite . they are parasitoids which lay their eggs in or on the caterpillars of other insect species . almost every insect pest species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it . this makes wasps critically important in the natural control of pest numbers ( biocontrol ) . parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they themselves do little or no damage to crops . farmers buy these parasitic wasps for insect control in their fields . with most species , the adult parasitic wasps themselves do not get any nutrients from their prey . much like bees , butterflies , and moths , those which do feed as adults usually get all of their nutrition from nectar . parasitic wasps are extremely varied in their habits . many lay their eggs in inert stages of their host ( egg or pupa ) . if the prey is a caterpillar , they paralyze it by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor . then they insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon the host externally . the host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae are mature , dying later when the parasitoids pupate , or when they emerge as adults . basically , the hosts are eaten alive .
