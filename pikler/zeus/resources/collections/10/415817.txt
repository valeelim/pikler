Victim blaming     victim blaming is holding the victim of a crime responsible for that crime . starting in the 1970s , the term was commonly used in the united states . it was mainly used in connection with trials for rape , as well those with a racist background . in 1947 theodor w. adorno defined what would be later called `` blaming the victim , '' as `` one of the most sinister features of the fascist character '' . shortly after , adorno and three other professors at the university of california , berkeley created their influential and highly debated `` f-scale '' ( f for fascist ) , published in `` the authoritarian personality '' ( 1950 ) , which included among the fascist traits of the scale the `` contempt for everything discriminated against or weak . '' a common example of victim blaming is the `` asking for it '' idiom , e.g . `` she was asking for it '' said of a victim of violence or sexual assault . roy baumeister , a social and personality psychologist , argued that blaming the victim is not always wrong . according to him , it can lead to new ideas that show that the victim was at least partly responsible for the act . baumeister argues that the common explanations of violence and cruelty are not helpful because they say that the victim was innocent . according to him , in the classic telling of `` the myth of pure evil , '' the innocent , well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by terrible villains . the situation , however , is not this simple ; in most cases , the victim has done something to either anger the offender , or to help the offender 's actions . in spite of this , the actions that follow may be more important than the `` victim 's '' first offense .
