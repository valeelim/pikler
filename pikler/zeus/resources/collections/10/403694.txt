Neurodiversity     neurodiversity is an approach to disability and learning which would indicate that different neurological conditions appear from normal variations of human genomes . the term `` neurodiversity '' began being used in the extremely late 1990s as a challenge to the current views of neurological diversity and focus as being inherently pathological . furthermore , the term would assert that neurological difference should be recognized and represented as a social category along with gender , human race , sexual orientations and disability status . examples of these differences include ( though are not limited to ) autism spectrum conditions , tourette syndrome , dyslexia , and more .
