Nitrogen narcosis     nitrogen narcosis is a problem for underwater divers . it affects the brain and nervous system a lot like alcohol , but goes away when the diver rises to a shallower depth . it does not have lasting effects after the depth is reduced . any underwater diver who goes deeper than 30 m ( 100 ft ) while breathing air , or any time when the pressure of nitrogen in the breathing gas is more than about 3,2 bar . it only happens when the pressure of nitrogen is high . if the pressure is kept low by staying at a shallower depth it will not happen . if the breathing gas has less nitrogen it will only start at a deeper depth . helium gas can be used in place of nitrogen in breathing gas for divers to make it less likely to have nitrogen narcosis . the nitrogen gas dissolved in the diver affects the working of nerve cells . at higher pressures more nitrogen can be dissolved . it starts off as a mild effect like being slightly drunk , but as the pressure increases it gets more serious , like getting more drunk . eventually the diver may lose consciousness .
