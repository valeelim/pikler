Universal priesthood (doctrine)    universal priesthood ( doctrine ) in christianity , different groups disagree about who can be a priest . protestant groups say that anyone who was baptized can be a priest . protestants say that anyone can directly talk to god , and no ordination is necessary to make someone a priest . in contrast , roman catholics say that the priest has a special function : he mediates between god and his people ; the function of the priest is to help people talk to god . for this reason , priests need special training . pope paul vi issued a papal bull called lumen gentium : in it , he stated the position the roman catholic church held after the second vatican council : christ the lord , high priest taken from among men , made the new people `` a kingdom and priests to god the father '' .the baptized , by regeneration and the anointing of the holy spirit , are consecrated ( .. ) a holy priesthood , in order that through all those works which are those of the christian man they may offer spiritual sacrifices and proclaim the power of him who has called them out of darkness into his marvelous light .
