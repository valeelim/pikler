Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction     the belousov–zhabotinsky reaction ( often shortened to `` bzr '' or `` bz '' ) is an example of a chemical oscillator . it is often used to illustrate a chaotic system . the bzr is made of several chemical reactions , that occur in sequence . it shows chemical oscillation , which is unusual for chemical reactions . at first it was thought to be a measurement error , or an artifact . it was thought that according to the second law of thermodynamics , this should not occur . according to this law , a system that is in an unordered state will not assume an ordered state on its own , that is without the provision of energy . however , this is only applicable in a closed system , and does not apply to the bz reaction . the reactions are theoretically important because they show that chemical reactions do not have to be dominated by equilibrium thermodynamic behavior . these reactions are far from equilibrium and remain so for a significant length of time . in this sense , they provide an interesting chemical model of nonequilibrium biological phenomena . the mathematical models of the bz reactions themselves are of theoretical interest .
