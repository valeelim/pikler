Obdurodon tharalkooschild     obdurodon tharalkooschild is an extinct species of platypus in the genus `` obdurodon '' . only one single tooth has been found . this was at the miocene fossil beds in riversleigh in queensland , australia . the tooth was discovered in 2012 by a team from the university of new south wales including mike archer , suzanne hand , and rebecca pian . the species lived during in the middle and upper miocene about 5â€“15 million years ago . wear on the tooth shows that it probably crushed hard shells such as those of turtles . because of this , scientists believe that `` o. tharalkooschild '' was carnivorous . they also believe that it was twice the size of the modern platypus at one metre long . its name was chosen in honour of an indigenous australian creation story for the platypus , where a duck named tharalkoo gives birth to a strange and fantastic creature after being ravished by a water-rat .
