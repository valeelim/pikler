Sociocultural theory     sociocultural theory was created by lev vygotsky as a response to behaviorism . the main idea of the theory is that the ways people interact with others and the culture they live in shape their mental abilities . vygotsky believed that parents , relatives , peers and society all have an important role in forming higher levels of functioning . sociocultural theory , as stated by cole , john-steiner , scribner and souberman , is the belief that `` every function in the child 's cultural development appears twice : first , on the social level , and later , on the individual level . '' this means that the skills children learn first are related to interactions with others and they then take that information and use it within themselves . lev vygotsky was born in 1896 in russia . he graduated from moscow university in 1917 and started his career as a psychologist during the russian revolution . he taught literature and psychology for seven years . vygotsky went against the leading scientists of his time by suggesting that scientific psychology should not ignore the role of consciousness . most scientists at the time disagreed with his ideas , however , he was still offered a job at the institute of psychology in moscow . there he worked on his new ideas of psychology .
