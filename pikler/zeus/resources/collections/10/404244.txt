Cuban Spanish     cuban spanish is a dialect of the spanish language . it is the dialect spoken in cuba . it shares many of the same features as other caribbean dialects of spanish . much of cuban spanish derives from the spanish spoken in the canary islands of spain . this is because large numbers of canarian people moved to cuba in the 19th and early 20th centuries . people from other spanish communities , such as galicians , catalans , basques and asturians , also moved here , but did not have as much influence on the language as the canarians did . many words in cuban spanish come from the canarian dialect , but some words are from other parts of spain . there are also words that come from west african languages , french , or from the indigenous ta√≠no language . the language is spoken differently from east to west . the eastern part of the island had large plantations where many african slaves worked during the 18th and 19th centuries . therefore , the east has a stronger influence from african languages ( such as yoruba and kikongo ) than the west . it is closer to dominican spanish than to the spanish spoken in the western part of the island . the haitian creole language influenced the eastern cuban culture after the haitian revolution . some words of the eastern dialect can be traced back to haitian creole words used every day locally . some cubans can still speak haitian creole .
