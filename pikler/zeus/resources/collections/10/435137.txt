Welfare economics     welfare economics is a field of economics that looks at the problem of allocating resources . it uses techniques from microeconomics to assess general well-being . from this assessment , it tries to find an allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy , often relative to competitive general equilibrium . it analyzes `` social welfare '' in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered . individuals and their economic activities are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare . the aggregation may focus on a group of people , a community , or a society . there is no `` social welfare '' apart from the `` welfare '' associated with its individual units . welfare economics typically takes individual preferences as given and tries to improve welfare in terms of pareto efficiency . as an example , social state b is `` better '' than social state a , if at least one person prefers `` b '' and no one else opposes it . another aspect of welfare treats income/goods distribution , including equality , as a further dimension of welfare .
