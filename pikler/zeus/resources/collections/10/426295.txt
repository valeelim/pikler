Assembler     in computer science an assembler is a program that turns assembly language into machine code . an assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer 's processor can use to perform its basic operations . some people call these instructions assembler language and others use the term assembly language . most computers come with a specified set of very basic instructions that correspond to the basic machine operations that the computer can perform . for example , a `` load '' instruction causes the processor to move a string of bits from a location in the processor 's memory to a special holding place called a register . assuming the processor has at least eight registers , each numbered , the following instruction would move the value ( string of bits of a certain length ) at memory location 3000 into the holding place called register 8 : the programmer can write a program using a sequence of these assembler instructions . this sequence of assembler instructions , known as the source code or source program , is then specified to the assembler program when that program is started .
