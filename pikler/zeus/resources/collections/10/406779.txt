Inferior good     in economics , an inferior good is a good that decreases in demand when the income of the consumer rises . people with little income might buy bread in the supermarket , but when their income increases , they buy their bread in the bakery instead . they did not buy from the bakery before , because the bread in the bakery is more expensive than the bread in the supermarket . goods where the demand rises with the income are called `` normal goods '' .
