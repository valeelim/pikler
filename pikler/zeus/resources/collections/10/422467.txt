Puffinus     puffinus is a genus of seabirds in the order procellariiformes . it is made up of about 20 small to medium-sized shearwaters . two other shearwater genera are named : `` calonectris '' , which comprises three large shearwaters , and `` procellaria '' with another four large species . the latter are usually called 'petrels ' , although they are thought to be more closely related to the shearwaters than to the other petrels . even though their name looks like `` puffin '' , the puffins are auks , and not related to the shearwaters in the genus `` puffinus '' ; the genus name `` puffinus '' is actually a new latin loanword based on the english `` puffin '' . genus `` puffinus '' - ( sub ) genus `` puffinus '' ( `` puffinus '' group ) – smaller species , closely related to `` calonectris '' - christmas shearwater , `` puffinus nativitatis `` - galápagos shearwater , `` puffinus subalaris '' - fluttering shearwater , `` puffinus gavia `` - hutton 's shearwater , `` puffinus huttoni `` - scarlett 's shearwater , `` puffinus spelaeus '' ( prehistoric ) - yelkouan shearwater , `` puffinus yelkouan ``
