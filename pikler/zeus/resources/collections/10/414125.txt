Atari 7800     the atari 7800 is a 8-bit video game console . it was competing with the nintendo entertainment system and the sega master system . it was atari 's third-to-last attempt to create another video game system that would be a successor to the atari 2600. it was a short-lived success . the atari 7800 is backwards compatible with atari 2600 games , but not atari 5200 games . the atari 7800 is also compatible with atari 2600 controllers , such as the atari paddle controller and the atari joystick controller . sub to me !
