Insulator (electricity)    insulator ( electricity ) an electrical insulator is a material that does not easily conduct an electric current . materials typically used to insulate include rubber , plastic and glass . in transformers and electric motors , varnish is used . insulating gases such as sulfur hexafluoride are used in some switches . wires that carry electric currents are usually insulated so the electricity goes to the right place . insulator can mean not only the material but things that are made of that material . they are made of various materials such as : glass , silicone , rubber , plastic , oil , wood , dry cotton , quartz , ceramic , etc . the type of insulator will depend on the uses . insulators have high electrical resistivity and low conductivity . the insulators prevent the loss of current and make the current more efficient by concentrating the flow . electric power transmission uses three types of overhead insulator : pin insulator , suspension insulator , and strain insulator . - the pin insulator is the earliest developed insulator . pin type insulators can have up to three parts , depending on the amount of voltage .
