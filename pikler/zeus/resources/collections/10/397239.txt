Color depth     in computer graphics , the term color depth is used to specify the `` amount '' of color used . usually it is measured in bits per pixel . one bit can represent two different values . it is known as monochrome or black and white . 16 bit color depth is known as `` high color '' , 24 bits per pixel are known as truecolor . there are also systems with color depths of 30 , 36 , or 48 bits per pixel . the rgb color model uses 8 bits per pixel , for a total of 24 bits . there may be an extra alpha channel , with another 8 bits ( so a total of 32 bits ) . phase alternating line , a standard for televisions uses 32 bits per pixel , with a yuv color space .
