Athelwald of Deira     athelwald ( also spelled oethelwald or Å“thelwald ) was a king of deira . he was the nephew of king oswiu of northumbria , his overlord , but he turned on his family to support the pagan penda of mercia . when penda was killed , athelwald lost his kingdom . he was the son of king oswald of northumbria , who was killed by penda of mercia at the battle of maserfield in 642. at oswald 's death northumbria was reduced back to the two kingdoms of bernicia and deira . oswiu was the king of bernicia and was acknowledge as overlord of deira . penda had placed oswine of deira on the throne of deira . but oswine did not get along with his overlord oswiu . he raised an army against oswiu but then realized his army was n't large enough and he sent them home . he was betrayed by one of his nobleman to oswiu and was murdered in 651. after oswine 's death , athelwald became king . it is uncertain whether oswiu ( who was athelwald 's uncle ) installed him as king or whether athelwald took the kingship in opposition to oswiu . at some point he allied himself with oswiu 's enemy , penda of mercia . he guided penda during his invasion of northumbria in 655. but , when the armies of oswiu and penda met on 15 november at the battle of the winwaed , athelwald withdrew to safety . penda was defeated and killed . perhaps in part because of this desertion , and afterward athelwald was not heard of again .
