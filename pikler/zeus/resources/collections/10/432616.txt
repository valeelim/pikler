Carbapenem     carbapenems are a class of antibiotics which act against a wide range of bacteria . their structure is difficult for bacterial enzymes to break down . they were originally developed from a product of `` streptomyces cattleya '' . carbapenems are one of the `` antibiotics of last resort '' for many bacterial infections , such as `` escherichia coli '' ( `` e. coli '' ) and `` klebsiella pneumoniae '' . recently , alarm has been raised about an `` indian superbug '' . this is a strain resistant to carapenems , which was discovered in delhi . this strain produces an enzyme which chops up the antibiotic molecule . at present there are no new antibiotics in development to replace carbapenems . however , some older antibiotics may treat bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems .
