Integron     an integron is a type of transposon , a mobile genetic element . it is a two-part genetic system found in bacteria , and maybe more widely . it is the way antibiotic resistance is passed on so rapidly . it is found in plasmids and chromosomes . although the first function discovered was antibiotic resistance , other bacterial functions ( traits ) can be transferred by integrons . transposons are the gene `` capture and expression elements '' which put the small mobile elements known as gene cassettes in place and make them work . usually , each cassette has only a single gene and a specific recombination site . the cassettes carry the dna coding ( = 'a gene ' ) for antibiotic resistance ( for example ) . typically , the dna would code for an enzyme which cleaves ( cuts ) the antibiotic molecule up . the first part of an integron is a gene which codes for an enzyme which captures cassettes . the second is a site on the genome where the cassettes are inserted , and a promoter which drives expression of cassette-associated genes . `` integron '' describes such structures both when no cassettes are present and when there are integrated cassettes . cassettes can be inserted at the site , they can be cut out , and they can undergo horizontal gene transfer .
