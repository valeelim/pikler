Fragile X syndrome     fragile x syndrome ( fxs ) is a genetic syndrome that causes a range of intellectual disabilities as well as unusual physical and behavioural characteristics . it is one of the most common causes of autism and mental retardation among boys . basically , these individuals lack an important gene product . fragile x syndrome occurs as a result of a mutation of the `` fmr1 '' gene on the x chromosome . this causes an increase an increase in the number of cgg repeats in the 5 ' untranslated region of `` fmr1 '' . in unaffected individuals , the `` fmr1 '' gene contains 5â€“44 repeats of the cgg codon , most commonly 29 or 30 repeats . between 45 and 54 repeats is considered a `` grey zone '' . between 55 and 200 repeats in length is described as a premutation allele . individuals with fragile x syndrome have a full mutation of the `` fmr1 '' allele , with over 200 repeats of the cgg codon . in these individuals with a repeat expansion greater than 200 , there is methylation of the cgg repeat expansion and `` fmr1 '' promoter . this silences the `` fmr1 '' gene , and its end-product is not made .
