Genetically modified organism     a genetically modified organism ( gmo ) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques . organisms that have been genetically modified include micro-organisms such as bacteria and yeast , insects , plants , fish , and mammals . gmos are the source of genetically modified foods , and are also widely used in scientific research and to produce goods other than food . 1970–1989 . 1972–1973 . - modern genetic engineering began in 1972 when united states biochemists herbert boyer and stanley cohen used enzymes to cut a bacteria plasmid and insert another strand of dna in the gap . both bits of dna were from the same type of bacteria , but this milestone , the invention of recombinant dna technology , offered a window into the previously impossible—the mixing of traits between totally dissimilar organisms . 1976–1977 . - allan maxam and walter gilbert developed a dna sequencing method based on chemical modification of dna and subsequent cleavage at specific bases .
