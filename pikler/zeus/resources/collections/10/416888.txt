Roman house     roman houses were of several types . those in rome were of at least three different types . ordinary people lived in apartment blocks called `` insulae '' , a kind of apartment building . it housed most people of lower- or middle-class status ( the plebs ) and all but the wealthiest from the upper-middle class ( the equites ) . insulae were of poor quality , but they did have running water and sanitation . rooms could be owned or rented . they were built in timber , mud brick , and later primitive concrete . they were restricted in height to about 20 metres . fires and collapses happened . among his many business interests , marcus licinius crassus speculated in real estate and owned numerous `` insulae '' in the city . when one collapsed from poor construction , cicero said that crassus was happy that he could charge higher rents for a new building than the collapsed one . houses of the rich and upper classes were lavish . the atrium was the most important part of the house . it was where guests were greeted . the atrium was open in the centre , surrounded at least in part by high-ceilinged porticoes that often contained only a little furniture to give the effect of a large space . in the centre was a square roof opening in which rainwater could come , draining inwards from the slanted tiled roof . the master 's office was placed so that the master could see what was going on . there were kitchens , bedrooms , a dining room , and a number of open rooms .
