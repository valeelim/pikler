Mockbuster     a mockbuster ( also called a knockbuster or a drafting opportunity ) is a movie made to take advantage of the publicity of a similar major movie . these types of movies are often made on a low budget . they are made to be released direct-to-video at the same time that the original movie is released in theaters or on video . mockbusters are often made to make customers mistakenly buy the movie instead of the one that they wanted . for example , someone may think that they are buying `` transformers '' , but they are actually buying `` transmorphers '' , a mockbuster that was released in 2007. because of this , a mockbuster will often use a title similar to the original movie . many mockbusters are made in a different country than the one that the original movie was made in . there are many turkish , italian , german , french and brazilian versions of american movies , as well as sequels that were not made by the people who made the original movie . other websites . - the mockbuster at tv tropes
