Great Heathen Army     the great heathen army , also called the great danish army or the great viking army , was a large force of danish vikings that attacked anglo-saxon england . this army appeared in east anglia in 865. unlike earlier vikings who made brief raids on england , the great army stayed for many years in an attempt to conquer all of england . the first recorded viking attack in england was in 793 at lindisfarne . the anglo-saxon chronicle reported `` the of heathen men miserably destroyed god 's church at lindesfarne . '' there were many reasons that vikings began attacking england . the populations of norway had been growing between the 7th and 9th centuries . the vikings were pagans who often had several wives and many sons . these young men filled the ranks of armies and joined ship 's crews to go on adventures . the beginning of trade between europe and england had opened up great trading centers . vikings were traders but at the same time resorted to piracy when it suited them . this was especially true when they found new lands and people who were not well protected .
