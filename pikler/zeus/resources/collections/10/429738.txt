Dimensional analysis     dimensional analysis is a method used in chemistry , physics , and other sciences . it is used to convert measurements and to find out something 's dimensions . sometimes it is called factor label method or unit analysis . any math done with numbers must also be done with their unit labels . for example , when dividing 50 miles driven by 2 gallons of gas used , you not only divide 50 by 2 to get a result of 25 , you also have to divide `` miles '' by `` gallons '' , which gives the unit `` miles/gallon '' or `` miles per gallon '' . the final answer is `` 25 miles per gallon '' . looking at the unit labels can help in choosing what to do with the numbers . for example , to convert 2.3 miles to some number of meters , use the equation `` 1609.34 meters equals one mile '' or 1609.34 meters per mile . using division , the unit labels will be miles/meters/mile , which ends up as miles/meter , which is not just the meters . with multiplication , the unit labels will be miles Ã— meters/mile . the miles will cancel , leaving just meters .
