Gyrocompass     a gyrocompass is a type of compass that does not use magnetism to point north . normal compasses do not work around magnets , or big pieces of ferrous metal . gyrocompasses do . this makes them very useful . a gyrocompass is a non-magnetic compass based on a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the earth it automatically finds geographical direction . although one part of a gyrocompass is a gyroscope , these are not the same devices . a crucial ingredient is needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass , so it would automatically position to true north . this is some mechanism that applies torque whenever the compass 's axis is not pointing north . successful methods have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses : - they find `` true '' north as determined by earth 's rotation , which is different from , and more useful than , `` magnetic '' north , and - they are unaffected by ferromagnetic materials , such as ship 's steel hull , which change the magnetic field
