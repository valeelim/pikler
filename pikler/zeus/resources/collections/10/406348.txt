Lance     a lance is a pole weapon or spear used by a mounted warrior . the lance is longer , thicker and heavier than an infantry spear , and is not intended for throwing , or for quick thrusting . lances did not have tips meant to break off or bend , unlike many throwing weapons of the spear and javelin family . they often had a vamplate , a small circular plate to prevent the hand sliding up the shaft upon impact . the lance was longer than a spear , about 9â€“10 feet long . when charging the lance was carried under the arm ( couched ) using the weight of the horse and rider to push the lance tip into its intended target . it was a medieval shock and awe weapon ( caused great fear ) to have a number of mounted knights with lances charging towards you . in may cases it caused panic and the enemy fled the battle . they were used by european knights , but the use of lances was spread over the old world wherever horses were available . the use of the lance was made possible by the use of the stirrup added to saddles . it allowed the knight to control the horse and stand in the saddle . as a backup weapon , lancers ( one who used a lance ) of that period also carried swords , maces ( a type of club ) or something else suited to hand-to-hand ( or close ) combat , since the lance was often used only once during an event . it could not be used once the combatants were close to each other .
