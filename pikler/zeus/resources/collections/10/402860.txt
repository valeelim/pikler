Hawking radiation     hawking radiation is black body radiation which is emitted by black holes , due to quantum effects near the event horizon . it is named after the physicist stephen hawking , who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974. hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation . because of this , black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish . micro black holes ( mbhs ) are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should shrink and dissipate faster .
