Ponthieu     ponthieu is a former province in northern france . its chief town is abbeville . it lies centered on the mouth of the somme river . it includes the townships of crecy-en-ponthieu , nouvion-en-ponthieu and ailly-le-haut-bell . ponthieu played a small role in the events that led up to the norman conquest of england in 1066. harold godwinson of england was blown ashore at ponthieu in 1064. he was taken captive by the men of guy i and held for at the castle of beaurain . thinking harold might be useful to him william ii , duke of normandy , secured his release . william escorted him to rouen and gave him many gifts . william then had harold take 'many oaths ' to support his claim to the english throne and to become william 's vassal . but a year after harold 's return to england when king edward the confessor died , harold quickly forgot his oaths and took the crown for himself . that same year harold was killed at battle of hastings and william became king of england . in 1067 the chaplain of matilda of flanders , guy , bishop of amiens , composed carmen de hastingae proelio , a latin poem on the battle of hastings .
