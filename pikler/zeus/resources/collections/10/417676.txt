History of science     the history of science is the study of the historical development of science and scientific knowledge . the english word `` scientist '' is relatively recent first coined by william whewell in the 19th century . previously , people investigating nature called themselves `` natural philosophers '' . science is a body of knowledge about the natural world , produced by scientists who observe , explain , and predict real world phenomena . historiography of science , in contrast , often draws on the historical methods . facts about the natural world have been described since classical antiquity . ancient greece is perhaps most famous for its contributions to astronomy and mathematics . aristarchus of samos came up with the idea of the sun at the centre of what we now call the solar system many centuries before galileo . others , like thales and aristotle were interested in the natural world . scientific methods have been used since the middle ages ( roger bacon ) , but the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century europe . important figures in the development of modern science include isaac newton , johannes kepler , robert boyle , charles darwin , wilhelm roux and albert einstein .
