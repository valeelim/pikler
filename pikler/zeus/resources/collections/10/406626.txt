Kary Mullis     kary banks mullis ( born 28 december 1944 ) is an american biochemist . in 1993 , he shared the nobel prize in chemistry with michael smith . the process of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was first described by kjell kleppe and 1968 nobel laureate h. gobind khorana . it allows specific dna sequences to be amplified ( multiplied hugely ) . mullis greatly improved the technique , and it became a standard tool in dna research . in 1983 , mullis was working for cetus corp. as a chemist . that spring , according to mullis , he was driving his vehicle late one night , when he had the idea to use a pair of primers to bracket the desired dna sequence and to copy it using dna polymerase . this would allow a small strand of dna to be copied almost an infinite number of times . cetus took mullis off his usual projects to concentrate on pcr full-time . mullis succeeded in demonstrating pcr on december 16 , 1983. cetus paid him a mere $ 10,000 for the discovery but later sold it to hoffmann-la roche , owned by roche holding ltd. , for $ 300 million .
