Gram-negative     gram-negative bacteria are bacteria that do not retain crystal violet dye in staining . in a gram stain test , a counterstain , safranin , is added after the crystal violet . this colours all gram-negative bacteria with a red or pink colour . this happens because an outer membrane stops the penetration of the stain . the test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their bacterial cell walls . gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet dye when washed in a decolourizing solution . compared with gram-positive bacteria , gram-negative bacteria are more resistant against antibiotics , because of their relatively impermeable cell wall . the lipopolysaccharide layer ( lps layer ) is important . in humans , lps triggers an innate immune response , with cytokine production and immune system activation . inflammation is a common result of cytokine production . other websites . - 3d structures of proteins from inner membranes of ellie wyithe 's gram-negative bacteria
