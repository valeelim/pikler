Inflation (cosmology)    inflation ( cosmology ) in physical cosmology , the idea of inflation is a proposed theory that would explain many features of the present-day universe , including the existence of large-scale structures such as galaxies . the theory was proposed by alan guth in the 1970s . based on the standard model of cosmology , the universe has been and is expanding . the classical big bang theory assumes that the universe expanded at the same rate throughout universal history . inflation says that the universe `` has not '' always expanded at the same rate , and that the universe has experienced many periods of brief but immense expansions in which the size of the universe nearly doubled . these periods , as said , were extremely short , lasting less than a second . after a single period , the expansion slowed down until the next rapid inflation came and , again , massively increased the size of the universe . the main problem solved by inflation is the origin of large-scale structures , such as galaxies . inflation theory says that in a slow expansion of the universe , quantum fluctuations were only on the tiny distance scales ; when the universe experienced a brief period of inflation , however , these quantum fluctuations are `` stretched '' much larger to cause density fluctuations . the places of higher density later caused matter to clump in those locations and form large-scale objects .
