Russell's paradox    russell 's paradox russell 's paradox is the theory that states : if you have a list of lists that do not list themselves , then that list must list itself , because it does n't contain itself . however , if it lists itself , it then contains itself , meaning it can not list itself . this makes logical usages of lists of lists that do n't contain themselves somewhat difficult . it was developed by bertrand russell .
