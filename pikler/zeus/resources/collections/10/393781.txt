Cerebral aneurysm     cerebral aneurysms , also called brain aneurysms , are a cerebrovascular issue in which weakness in the walls of a cerebral artery causes localized dilation or ballooning in the blood vessel . small , unchanging aneurysms may produce very few symptoms . however , before a larger aneurysm ruptures , individuals may experience sudden or severe headaches , nausea , vomiting and vision problems . the rupture may also directly cause serious damage directly to the brain , usually from the bleeding itself-this is a hemorrhagic stroke that can lead to and may cause arm or leg weakness or paralysis and speech troubles . cerebral aneurysms may result due to congenital defect , high blood pressure or head trauma . onsets are sometimes sudden and without warning , and such ruptures are extremely dangerous and usually result in bleeding into the brain itself , leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage , which then constitutes a stroke . this condition may lead to death or permanent disability for some individuals .
