Ur (supercontinent)    ur ( supercontinent ) ur was a supercontinent that formed 3.1 billion years ago in the early archaean eon ( during the mesoarchaean era ) . it might have been the oldest continent on earth , half a billion years older than arctica . however , one other supercontinent , vaalbara , may have come before ur . vaalbara might have formed about 3.6 billion years ago . ur joined with the continents nena and atlantica about 1 billion years ago to form the supercontinent rodinia . ur survived as a single unit until it was separated when the supercontinent pangaea broke apart into laurasia and gondwana . rocks that made up ur are now parts of africa , australia , and india . in the early period of ur 's existence , it was probably the only continent on earth . therefore , scientists call ur a supercontinent , even though it was probably smaller than australia is now . today 's new zealand is similar to ur , but rotated 90 degrees out of phase , and about too far south . when ur was the only continent on earth , all other land was in the form of small granite islands and small land-masses like vaalbara , which were not large enough to be continents .
