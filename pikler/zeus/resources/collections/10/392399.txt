Earth's magnetic field    earth 's magnetic field the earth ’ s magnetic field is the magnetic field that surrounds the earth . it is sometimes called the `` geomagnetic field '' . the earth ’ s magnetic field is created by the rotation of the earth and earth 's core . it shields the earth against harmful particles in space . the field is unstable and has changed often in the history of the earth . as the earth spins the two parts of the core move at different speeds and this is thought to generate the magnetic field around the earth as though it had a large bar magnet inside it . the magnetic field creates magnetic poles that are near the geographical poles . a compass uses the geomagnetic field to find directions . many migratory animals also use the field when they travel long distances each spring and fall . the magnetic poles will trade places during a magnetic reversal . the earth ’ s geomagnetic field is created because of two things . the convective motions in the liquid conducting core inside the center of the earth are important for making the magnetic field . when the convective motions occur with the electrical currents around the earth , the magnetic field is created . the earth ’ s rotation is what keeps the magnetic field up . the interaction between the convective motions and the electrical currents creates a dynamo effect .
