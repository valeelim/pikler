Royal forest     a royal forest is an area of land with various meanings , but basically it is woodland once owned by monarchs . in anglo-saxon england , the kings were great huntsmen but they never set aside areas forbidden to other users . historians find no evidence of the anglo-saxon monarchs ( c.500 to 1066 ) creating forests . however , under the norman kings ( after 1066 ) , no hunting was allowed on royal lands except by authority of the king . the law was designed to protect the `` venison '' and the `` vert '' , the `` noble '' animals of the chase – notably red and fallow deer , the roe , and the wild boar – and the greenery which sustained them . royal forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or ( by invitation ) the aristocracy . the concept was introduced by the normans to england in the 11th century , and in the late 12th and early 13th centuries , one-third of the land area of southern england was designated as royal forest . at one stage in the 12th century , all of essex was afforested , and on his accession henry ii declared all of huntingdonshire to be royal forest .
