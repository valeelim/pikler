Hell house     hell houses are attractions normally run by christian churches . they show sin , the torture of the damned in hell , and usually end with a depiction of heaven . they are normally run on halloween . a hell house is like a haunted house attraction . it is a building used for actors attempting to frighten people with gruesome exhibits and scenes . they are presented as a series of short vignettes with a guide . unlike haunted houses , hell houses focus on the effects of sin or the fate of unrepentant sinners in the afterlife . they occur during the month of october to take advantage of the similarities between hell houses and haunted houses .
