Cytotoxic T cell     a cytotoxic t cell is a type of white blood cell . it is a t lymphocyte which kills cancer cells , cells infected with viruses , or cells that are damaged in other ways . most cytotoxic t cells have t-cell receptors ( tcrs ) which recognize a specific antigen from a cancer cell or virus . antigens inside a cell are brought to the surface of the cell by major histocompatibility complex molecules , where they can be recognized by the t cell . if the tcr is specific for that antigen , it binds to the complex of mhc molecule and antigen , and the t cell destroys the cell .
