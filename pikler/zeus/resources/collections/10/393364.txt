Ice core     an ice core is a long piece of ice taken from a glacier . the ice is drilled very deep , so that the ice core goes back to old ice at the bottom of the glacier . usually , ice cores are taken from antarctica , greenland or very high mountains . snow falls on ground and accumulates ( gets deeper ) . as more snow falls , the bottom layers get compacted ( thinner ) because of the weight on top . in the end , only ice remains , and all air goes away . the deeper the ice , the older it is . ice cores can be dated by looking at the layers : often every season can be seen in the ice core because it forms a layer . at other times it is more difficult to find out how old the ice is . other methods can be used , like measuring conductivity or making mathematical models . scientists study ice cores to find out how the climate was in the past . the ice keeps information like gases , particles , ash from volcanoes . the type of water that forms the ice can be used to calculate the temperature of earth . ice cores help us know what the temperature was on the planet in the past 800 thousand years . we know more about ice ages that happen periodically . this is a helpful addition to our knowledge about global warming .
