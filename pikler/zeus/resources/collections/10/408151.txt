Animalia Paradoxa     animalia paradoxa is the label given to a few species of animal , listed in carolus linnaeus early editions of systema naturae . linn√© thought that these animals did not make sense . today , such animals are usually called cryptids . the respective section lists fantastic creatures found in medieval bestiaries as well as those reported by explorers from abroad and gives explanations to why they are excluded from systema naturae . according to swedish historian gunnar broberg , it was to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition . `` paradoxa '' was dropped from linnaeus ' classification system as of the 6th edition ( 1748 ) . included in the 1st ( 1735 ) edition : - hydra : in 1735 linnaeus inspected the alleged remains of a hydra in hamburg which turned out to be made from weasels and snake skins . - rana-piscis : a south american frog which is significantly smaller than its tadpole stage ; it was thus ( incorrectly ) reported to linnaeus that the metamorphosis in this species went from 'frog to fish ' . in the 10th edition of systema naturae , linnaeus named the species `` rana paradoxa '' , though its genus name was changed in 1830 to `` pseudis '' .
