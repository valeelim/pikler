Biodegradation     biodegradation is a chemical process in which materials are dissolved by bacteria or other biological elements . if a material is `` biodegradable '' , it means that it can be consumed by microorganisms and turned into compounds that are natural . it is an important process in ecology and waste management . items that are biodegradable are considered environmentally friendly because they can turn back into elements found in nature . organic materials , such as those that come from plants and animals , can be degraded aerobically ( with oxygen ) or anaerobically ( without oxygen ) . some artificial or inorganic materials can also be biodegraded . it is possible to identify specific microorganisms that are able to biodegrade these materials . in nature , different materials biodegrade at different speeds . most microorganisms that help biodegradation need light , heat , water and oxygen . related pages . - compost
