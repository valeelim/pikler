Saturnalia (dinosaur)    saturnalia ( dinosaur ) saturnalia is an extinct genus of basal prosauropod dinosaur from the triassic of rio grande do sul , southern brazil . the deposits are dated to the early upper triassic , about 225 million years ago ( mya ) . the dinsaur grew to about 1.5 meters ( 5 ft ) long . the primitive nature of `` saturnalia '' , and its mixture of sauropodomorph and theropod characteristics , has made it difficult to classify . the first ( 1999 ) description of the genus assigned it to the sauropodomorpha . however , in a 2003 paper , langer noted that features of its skull and hand were more similar to the sister group of sauropodomorphs , the theropods , and that `` saturnalia '' could be considered a member of the sauropodomorph `` stem-lineage '' , rather than a true member of that group . jos√© bonaparte and colleagues , in a 2007 study , found `` saturnalia '' to be very similar to the primitive saurischian `` guaibasaurus '' . bonaparte placed the two in the same family , guaibasauridae . like langer , bonaparte found that these forms may have been primitive sauropodomorphs , or an assemblage of forms close to the common ancestor of the sauropodomorphs and theropods . overall , bonaparte found that both `` saturnalia '' and `` guaibasaurus '' were more theropod-like than prosauropod-like . however , all more recent cladistic analyses found it to be a very basal sauropodomorph ,
