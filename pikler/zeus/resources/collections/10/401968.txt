Conus     conus is a large genus of small to large predatory sea snails , marine gastropod molluscs , with the common names of `` cone snails '' , `` cone shells '' or `` cones '' . shaped , as the name suggests , like a cone , many species have colorful patterning on the shell surface . `` conus '' snails are mostly tropical in distribution . geologically speaking , the genus is known from the eocene to the present . all `` conus '' snails are poisonous . they hunt and eat marine worms or molluscs . the larger ones prey on small bottom-dwelling fish . cone snails use a hypodermic-like modified radula tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their prey before eating it . the tooth is sometimes likened to a dart or a harpoon . it is barbed and can be extended some distance out from the mouth of the snail , at the end of the proboscis . they can `` sting '' humans , and should be handled with great care or preferably not at all . cone snail venoms are mainly peptides . the venoms contain many different toxins that vary in their effects ; some are extremely toxic . the sting of small cones is no worse than a bee sting , but the sting of some larger species can be serious , occasionally even fatal to humans . according to goldfrank 's `` toxicologic emergencies '' , only about 15 human deaths were caused by cone snail stings .
