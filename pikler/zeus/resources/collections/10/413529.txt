Vasoconstriction     vasoconstriction occurs when blood vessels become narrower because of the tightening of the muscles in their walls . its opposite is vasodilation , which is when blood vessels widen . for example , when you are cold , blood vessels near the skin vasoconstrict so that you do n't lose too much heat from your blood . when blood vessels vasoconstrict , this increases blood pressure . sometimes , blood pressure is too high and this can cause heart disease , so people have to take medicine to make the muscles in the blood vessels relax .
