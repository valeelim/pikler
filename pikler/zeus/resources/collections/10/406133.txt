Destrier     the destrier is the best-known type of warhorse of the medieval era . it carried knights in battles , tournaments , and jousts . it was described by contemporary sources as the `` great horse '' , due to its significance . the word `` destrier '' comes from the vulgar latin `` dextarius '' , meaning `` right-sided '' ( the same root as our modern `` dexterous '' and `` dexterity '' ) . this may refer to it being led by the squire at the knight 's right side ( or led by the right hand ) or to the horse 's gait , ( possibly leading with the right ) . while highly prized by knights and men-at-arms , the destrier was not very common . most knights and mounted men-at-arms rode other war horses , such as coursers and rounceys . these three types of horse were often called chargers . the word `` destrier '' does not refer to a breed , but to a `` type '' of horse : the finest and strongest warhorse . these horses were usually stallions , bred and raised from colts specifically for the needs of war . the destrier was also considered the most suited to the joust ; coursers seem to have been preferred for other forms of warfare . they had powerful hindquarters , able to easily coil and spring to stop , spin , turn or sprint forward . they also had a short back and well-muscled loin , strong bone , and a well-arched neck . from medieval art , the head of the destrier appears to have had a straight or slightly convex profile , strong , wide jaw , and good width between the eyes .
