Nucleoplasm     nucleoplasm is the contents of the cell nucleus . it is the protoplasm inside the nuclear membrane . it includes - many smaller molecules , and water - large molecules such as enzymes of many types , and nucleotides - larger organelles such as the chromosomes and the nucleoli - a network of nucleolar channels makes a continuous chain between the nucleoplasm and the inner parts of the nucleolus . ribosomes made in the nucleolus get sent to the endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm . the main role of the nucleoplasm is to keep the chromosomes separate from the cell cytoplasm , and support the translating of dna to rna
