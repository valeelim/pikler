Dere Street     dere street ( later `` via regia '' in scotland ) was a roman road in britain . it ran between eboracum ( york ) and the antonine wall at bo'ness ( veluniate ) , in what is now scotland . dere street still exists as the route of major roads , including the a1 and a68 just north of corbridge . its name comes from the post roman anglo-saxon kingdom of deira , through which the first part of its route lies . it was sometimes referred to as `` watling street '' and marked on some maps as such . this can cause it to be confused with the watling street that linked dover with wroxeter .
