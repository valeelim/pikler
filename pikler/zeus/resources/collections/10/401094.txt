Messier 82     messier 82 ( also known as ngc 3034 , cigar galaxy or m82 ) is the nearby starburst galaxy about 12 million light years away in the constellation ursa major . it is five times brighter than the whole milky way and one hundred times brighter than our galaxy 's center . in 2005 , the hubble space telescope revealed 197 young massive clusters in the starburst core . the average mass of these clusters is around 2 `` m '' , hence the starburst core is a very energetic and high-density environment . throughout the galaxy 's center , young stars are being born 10 times faster than they are inside our entire milky way galaxy . m82 is being physically affected by its larger neighbor , nearby spiral m81 . tidal forces caused by gravity have deformed m82 , a process that started about 100 million years ago . this interaction has caused star formation to increase tenfold compared to `` normal '' galaxies . recently , m82 has undergone at least one tidal encounter with m81 . this resulted in a large amount of gas being funnelled into the galaxy 's core over the last 200 million years ( myr ) . the most recent such encounter is thought to have happened around 2–5 years ago and resulted in a concentrated starburst together with a marked peak in the cluster age distribution . this starburst ran for up to ~50 myr at a rate of ~10 `` m '' per year . two subsequent starbursts followed , the last of which ( ~4–6 myr ago ) may have formed the core star clusters .
