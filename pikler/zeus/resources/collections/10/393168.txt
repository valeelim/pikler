Appalachian English     appalachian english is a dialect of the english language . it is spoken in the appalachian mountains region . research suggests it is one of the most unique dialects in the united states . since the 1930s , a lot of research has been done to figure out where the dialect came from . one theory is that the dialect is a remnant of elizabethan ( or shakespearean ) english that had been preserved by the region 's isolation . another theory suggests that the dialect developed out of the scots-irish and anglo-scottish border dialects brought to the region by some of its earliest british isles settlers . recent research suggests that appalachian english developed as a uniquely american dialect as early settlers re-adapted the english language to their unfamiliar frontier environment . this is supported by many similarities between the appalachian dialect and colonial american english .
