Ship of the line     a ship of the line was a kind of warship . most ships of the line were built between the 17th and 19th century . at that time , battles were fought by many such ships , which sailed in a line . at first , such ships were sailing boats , but from about the 1840s , steam-driven ships of the line were built . the steam-powered ships of the line were still made of wood . from about 1859 , the ironclad warship replaced them . at that time , ships had cannons . larger ships had room for more cannons , and were therefore more likely to hit the enemy . today , ship designs are noticeably different , as cannons are no longer used .
