Vega     vega ( α lyr , α lyrae , alpha lyrae ) is the brightest star in the constellation lyra . it is the fifth brightest star in the night sky and the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere , after arcturus . at only 25 light-years from earth , it is a relatively close star and one of the most luminous stars in the sun 's neighborhood . vega has been extensively studied by astronomers : this led it to be called `` arguably the next most important star in the sky after the sun '' . vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 bc and will be so again around the year 13,727. vega was the first star other than the sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded . it was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements . vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the astronomical brightness scale . vega is only about a tenth of the age of the sun , but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the sun . both stars are at present near the midpoint of their life expectancies .
