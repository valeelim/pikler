Silo     a silo is a building that holds silage . silage is green chopped plants ( usually grass or corn stalks ) that is kept wet ( this is different than hay , which is stored dry ) . it ferments and can be kept all winter . it makes good food for livestock , particularly dairy cows . the silo is a fairly recent part of the farmyard . it was first widely used in the late 1800 's . they are still used today . while silage can be stored in many ways , the typical silo is a tall cylinder . it usually has a cone or dome cap on top . there is an opening at the top to put silage in , and doors running down one side to take it out . originally a farmer would climb the outside of the silo to the top of the silage , go inside , and shovel out the silage . there is typically a chute on the outside , and the silage would fall down the chute , where it could be gathered and fed to the cows . now there is machinery that does that job .
