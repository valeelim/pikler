Chapman Pincher     harry chapman pincher ( 29 march 1914 â€“ 5 august 2014 ) was an indian-born british journalist , historian , and novelist . pincher was born on 29 march 1914 in ambala , punjab . his father was from britain and his mother was american . pincher studied at darlington grammar school and king 's college london . pinker wrote a series of books on supposed kgb spies in the west , mostly members of the british ruling class whom he believed were traitors in the service of the kgb . among these were roger hollis , former head of mi5 , and harold wilson , twice prime minister in the 1960s and 70s . many of these ideas had come from james jesus angleton , former cia counterespionage chief . angleton 's career ended when his many allegations were not supported with appropriate evidence . among his more outrageous claims was that canadian prime ministers lester pearson and pierre trudeau were agents of the soviet union . another source was peter wright , a former assistant director of mi5 . the british government tried to prevent the publication of wright 's own `` spycatcher '' ( 1987 ) , which covered much the same ground as pincher 's `` their trade is treachery '' . wright had published in australia , and the australian court case ran on for years with no success . in the event , nothing was proved against hollis , who was the main target of `` their trade is treachery '' . later british prime ministers stated that hollis was a loyal servant of the crown , and that a great injustice had been done to him by the pincher and wright books .
