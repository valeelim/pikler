Muhammed Ahmed     muhammad ahmad bin abd allah ( 12 august 1845 â€“ 22 june 1885 ) was a religious leader of the sufi samaniyya order in sudan . on 29 june 1881 , he proclaimed himself as the mahdi or messianic redeemer of the islamic faith . his proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the arabic part of the sudanese population . they resented the oppressive policies of their turco-egyptian rulers ( who were also muslims ) . there were messianic beliefs among the various sudanese religious sects of the time . there were earlier mahdist movements in west africa , and wahhabism and other puritanical forms of islamic revivalism . the root cause of this was the growing military and economic dominance of the european powers throughout the 19th century . the british influenced the sudan , and had claimed it as a `` joint anglo-egyptian condominion '' . in general , the british were behind the rule of the khedives of the muhammad ali pasha dynasty in egypt . at the time of the mahdi , egypt and the sudan were ruled jointly by tewfik pasha as recognised by the ottoman empire , and by the british . britain 's claim to the sudan led to british forces being sent there after the mahdi had beaten the forces of the khedive . the british government appointed general charles george gordon to be governor general of the sudan , and that led to his famous death in khartoum at the hands of the mahdi 's forces .
