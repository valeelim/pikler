Railgun     a railgun is a gun that fires metal projectiles ( bullets ) using a magnetic field produced by electricity . unlike conventional guns , it does not use brass casings or gunpowder , and rarely needs to be cleaned or unjammed . currently most railguns are experimental and are not used in war yet , but the u.s. army is expecting to create one for war within the next few decades . in theory , a railgun could fire a bowling-ball-sized projectile fast enough to destroy a small building , even over long distances . railguns are usually very large and not portable because of the need for a large power supply . there have been proposals to use the same technology for non-weapon purposes , such as aircraft and spacecraft launchers and specialized tools .
