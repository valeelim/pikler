Surface-mount technology     surface-mount technology uses electronics that are made to be placed ( or stamped ) directly onto one side of printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) . examples of surface-mount devices are resistors , capacitors , leds and integrated circuits . surface mounted devices are generally smaller than those used in the older through-hole technology , which need longer leads and holes in the circuit board .
