EPR paradox     the epr paradox is an early and strong criticism of quantum mechanics . albert einstein and his co-workers , boris podolsky and nathan rosen , said that niels bohr , werner heisenberg , and the other scientists in copenhagen were wrong about uncertainty . heisenberg claimed that you could never know , for any one time , both the position and momentum ( or velocity , or trajectory ) of any atom-sized or smaller particle . the idea was that the two could not be measured at the same time , and that as soon as one was measured a change would occur and you would not get the same answer for the other one that you would have gotten if you had measured it first . einstein and his group said that heisenberg should think again . suppose you had two very small particles . you measured the weight of each of them and then stuck them together . you gave them a little push . then something broke them apart . they should have both positions and velocities that were related . so if you measured the position of one of them , then even if you assumed that heisenberg was right and you could not involve messing up its velocity in the process of measuring it , surely that did not mean that it never had a definite velocity . for proof , einstein said that you could next measure the velocity of the second particle and , since everything was mathematically related , you would then know the velocity of the first particle .
