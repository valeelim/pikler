Nuclease     a nuclease is an enzyme which cuts the bonds between the nucleotide subunits of nucleic acids . well known nucleases are deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease . nucleases may have the prefix `` endo '' or `` exo '' added to the name . endonucleases break nucleic acid chains somewhere in the middle of the molecule . exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of dna molecules . a restriction endonuclease does a specific job . it scans the length of a dna molecule . once it finds a particular sequence , it binds to the dna molecule and makes a cut in each of the two sugar-phosphate backbones . different endonucleases cut in different places , but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way , no matter what dna molecule it is acting on . once the cuts have been made , the dna molecule breaks into fragments . in fact , more than 900 restriction enzymes , some sequence specific and some not , have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria since their discovery . these enzymatic tools were important to scientists who were gathering the tools needed to `` cut and paste '' dna molecules . they needed a tool to cut dna at specific sites , rather than at random sites along the length of the molecule . this way they could cut dna molecules in a predictable way .
