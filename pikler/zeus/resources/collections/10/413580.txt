Age of the universe     in cosmology , the age of the universe is the amount of time since the big bang . the best measurement of the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years ( specifically , 13.798±0.037 billion years ) . the most recent and most accurate measurements were made by the planck spacecraft . these measurements were made using the cosmic microwave background radiation and the expansion of the universe . in the 1800s , evidence from geology showed that the earth was at least millions of years old . later , it was thought that the universe was unchanging . however , in the 1920s , georges lemaître and edwin hubble determined that the universe was expanding ( see hubble 's law ) . although the estimates made using the initial data were low , radioactive dating on earth could be used to give measurements of 11–20 billion years to 13–15 billion years . eventually , scientists were able to make much better measurements using spacecraft .
