Ribozyme     a ribozyme ( ribonucleic acid enzyme ) is an rna molecule that can help certain biochemical reactions . similar to the action of protein enzymes . also called `` catalytic rna '' , ribozymes work in the ribosome to link amino acids during protein synthesis . they also take part in rna splicing , viral replication , and transfer rna biosynthesis . the 1981 discovery of ribozymes showed rna can be both genetic material ( like dna ) and a biological catalyst ( like enzymes ) . this led to the rna world hypothesis , in which rna acts in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems . investigators studying the origin of life have produced ribozymes in the laboratory that can catalyze their own synthesis under certain conditions , such as an rna polymerase ribozyme . improved variants of the `` round-18 '' polymerase ribozyme have been developed . `` b6.61 '' is able to add up to 20 nucleotides to a primer template in 24 hours , until it decomposes by cleavage of its phosphodiester bonds . the `` tc19z '' ribozyme can add up to 95 nucleotides with great accuracy .
