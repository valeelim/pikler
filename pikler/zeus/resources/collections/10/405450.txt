Point mutation     a point mutation is a `` single base substitution '' . it is the smallest type of mutation possible . in a point mutation , either : 1. a single base nucleotide is changed for another nucleotide of the genetic material ( normally dna ) , or 1. a single base pair is inserted or deleted . a nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a dna sequence that leads to an early stop codon . this appears as a nonsense codon in the transcribed mrna . most of the time , the protein that is translated from this mrna does not work .
