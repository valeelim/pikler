Anjou     anjou ( ) is a former county , duchy ( 1360 ) and province centred on the city of angers in the lower loire valley of western france . its traditional latin name was `` andegavia '' . anjou , or then the angevin march ( border lands ) formed the border between neustria and aquitaine . it also bordered between neustria and brittany . sitting on a black slate rock was the roman of angers . it guarded the rivers mayenne and loire that flowed around it . the founder or first count of anjou was ingelger . anjou became a part of england from 1151-1199 , when henry ii inherited the county . he became the count of anjou in addition to his other titles . his ( third ) son richard the lionheart became count after his father . at the peak of its power the angevin empire spread from ulster to the pyrenees . richard had no legitimate issue , so in 1199 anjou passed to his nephew , arthur of brittany . he was the son of geoffrey , duke of brittany . the crown of england passed to henry ii ’ s fifth son and richard ’ s youngest brother , john . arthur was taken prisoner by king john in 1203 and was never seen again . in 1204 , anjou was taken back by philip ii of france . it was later elevated to a duchy for prince louis , the second son of john ii of france . it remained a duchy until the french revolution . today , anjou corresponds largely to the present-day `` département '' of maine-et-loire .
