Machaeroides     machaeroides ( `` dagger-like '' ) was a genus of sabre-toothed creodonts which lived during the eocene ( 56 to 34 mya ) . its fossils were found in the u.s. state of wyoming . it is the earliest known sabre-toothed mammal . it looked like a small , dog-sized saber-toothed cat . `` machaeroides '' could be distinguished from feliforms by their longer skulls , and their plantigrade stance . they walked with their feet flat on the ground , whereas cats walk on their toes . the long survival of these small animals shows that their killing method suited small cats as well as large cats .
