Westerlund 1     westerlund 1 ( wd1 , also called ara cluster ) is a compact young super star cluster . it is in the milky way galaxy , about 3.5–5 kiloparsecs ( 12000–16000 light years ) away from earth . it is the most massive compact young star cluster known in the entire local group of galaxies . it was discovered by bengt westerlund in 1961. it remained largely unstudied for many years due to high interstellar extinction ( absorption ) in its direction . in the future , it will probably evolve into a globular cluster . the cluster contains a large number of rare , evolved , high-mass stars , including : 6 yellow hypergiants , 4 red supergiants , 24 wolf-rayet stars , a luminous blue variable , many ob supergiants , and an unusual supergiant sgb [ e star ] ] which may be the remnant of a recent stellar merger . in addition , x-ray observations have revealed the presence of a strange x-ray pulsar , a slow rotating neutron star that must have formed from a high-mass progenitor star . westerlund 1 is believed to have formed in a single burst of star formation , so the stars have similar ages and compositions .
