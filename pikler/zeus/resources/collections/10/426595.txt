Attrition warfare     a war of attrition is a military strategy in which one side tries to cause so many losses of soldiers and so much destruction of military equipment that it wears down the enemy forces until they collapse . the side with more resources ( soldiers and military equipment ) is the side that usually wins . military experts like sun tzu say attrition is not the best way to win a war . a famous quote by sun tzu is `` the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting '' . in a war of attrition both parties think they can win . one is always wrong and often , both are wrong . they can both end up with fewer resources than when they began . ideally , wars are won using the least numbers of soldiers and weapons possible . another form of attrition warfare is the search and destroy operations used by the united states during the vietnam war . that same conflict proved that wars of attrition do not work when your enemy is willing to absorb higher losses and continue a war indefinitely .
