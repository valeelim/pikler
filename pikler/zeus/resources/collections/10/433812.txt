Homology (mathematics)    homology ( mathematics ) in mathematics , homology is a certain procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules with a mathematical object , such as a topological space or a group . the word homology has the ancient greek root `` homos '' , which means `` identical '' . for a topological space , the homology groups are generally much easier to compute than the homotopy groups , and consequently one usually will have an easier time working with homology to help with the classification of spaces . the original motivation for defining homology groups is the observation that shapes are distinguished by their `` holes '' . since a `` hole '' is defined by something that is `` not there '' , this poses the problem of how to define what a hole is , and how to distinguish between different kinds of holes . homology is a rigorous mathematical method for defining and categorizing holes in a shape . as it turns out , there are some kinds of holes that homology can not `` see '' â€” in which case homotopy groups may be what is needed .
