Cauchy's integral formula    cauchy 's integral formula in mathematics , cauchy 's integral formula is a central statement in complex analysis . the statement is named after augustin-louis cauchy . it expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk . the statement also provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function . cauchy 's formula shows that , in complex analysis , `` differentiation is equivalent to integration '' : complex differentiation , like integration , behaves well under uniform limits â€“ a result denied in real analysis .
