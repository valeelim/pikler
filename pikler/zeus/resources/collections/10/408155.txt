Wood carving     wood carving is a form of working wood by means of a cutting tool . a chisel or knife are usual tools : the chisel can be tapped with a wooden mallet . the result is a wooden figure , or the sculptural ornamentation of a wooden object . a 'wood carving ' may also refer to the finished product . the making of sculpture in wood has a long history . wood survives much less well than the other materials such as stone and bronze . it is vulnerable to decay , insect damage , and fire . therefore , we do not know much about wood in the art history of older cultures . outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world , so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed . many of the most important sculptures of china and japan are in wood , also most african sculpture and that of oceania and other regions . wood is light , so it is suitable for masks and other objects meant to be carried . it can take very fine detail , and is also much easier to work than stone . some of the finest examples of early european wood carving are from the middle ages in germany , russia , italy and france , where the typical themes of that era were used in christian icons . in england many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century , when oak was often used . in general , really fine carving is done in fruitwood ( wood of a fruit tree ) because that is easy to work with . the famous woodcarver grinling gibbons used to work with lime wood . complex pieces are often carved in separate sections which are later stuck together .
