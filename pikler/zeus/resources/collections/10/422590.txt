Roman food     roman food was mainly obtained from the mediterranean area and gaul ( now spain ) . romans enjoyed foodstuffs from the trade networks of the roman republic and empire . keeping up the food supply to the city of rome was a major political issue in the late republic . it became one of the ways the emperor expressed his relationship to the roman people . three meals a day was normal in ancient rome , as today . in the morning , a breakfast called the `` ientaculum '' was served at dawn . later , around 11:00 am , romans ate a small lunch , and in the evening , they ate the `` cena '' , the main meal of the day . in the empire period , the `` cena '' increased in size and diversity . it was now eaten in the afternoon . the `` vesperna '' , a light supper in the evening , was abandoned , and a second breakfast was introduced around noon , the `` prandium '' . in the lower strata of society , the old routine was kept : it corresponded more closely to the daily rhythms of manual labor . originally flat , round loaves made of emmer ( a cereal related to wheat ) with a bit of salt were eaten ; among the upper classes , eggs , cheese , and honey , along with milk and fruit were also consumed . in the empire period , around the beginning of the christian era , bread made of wheat was introduced . later , more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer bread . poor romans ate bread , vegetable , soup and porridge . meat and shellfish were a luxury , unless they lived in the countryside and could go hunting or fishing .
