Wankel engine     the wankel engine is a type of combustion engine . it is sometimes called a rotary engine . the wankel engine is better than an engine of the reciprocating piston design because it is more compact and simple . however , so far , nobody has found a good enough solution to the fact that oil ( lubricant ) has to be burnt along with the fuel . this causes pollution issues , besides wasting oil . this is why most vehicles still use piston engines .
