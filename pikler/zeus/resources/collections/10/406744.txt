Pike (weapon)    pike ( weapon ) a pike is a pole weapon . it is a very long heavy thrusting spear formerly used by infantry . a pike is not intended to be thrown . pikes were used regularly in european warfare starting in the early middle ages . until around 1700 pikes were used by foot soldiers in close order formations . the pike was a long weapon that got longer over time . it could be as long as 20 feet . it had a wooden shaft with an iron or steel . it had metal along the sides for three feet behind the tip to keep it from being cut off by a sword or axe . when a number of pikes are used together it allowed a great concentration of spearheads an enemy could not get through . the length also kept the soldier at a greater distance . but the length also made pikes difficult to use in close combat . were usually arranged in a very close tight formation of several lines deep . the earliest of these were called a phalanx formation . it was used by the macedonians under philip ii of macedon . it was used by the armies of the pharoahs in ancient egypt . it was later used by the swiss pike columns but this formation was probably based on the scottish schildrons . the armies of william wallace and robert the bruce used it to great success against the heavy cavalry of kings edward i of england and his son edward ii of england .
