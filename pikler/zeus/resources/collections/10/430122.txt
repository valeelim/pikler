Linear regression     linear regression is a special case of regression analysis , which tries to explain the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables . mathematical functions are used to predict or estimate the value of the dependent variables . in linear regression , these functions are linear . linear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously . this is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters . what is more , the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine . linear regression has many practical uses . most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories : - linear regression can be used to fit a predictive model to a set of observed values ( data ) . this is useful , if the goal is prediction , or forecasting , or reduction . after developing such a model , if an additional value of `` x '' is then given without its accompanying value of `` y '' , the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the value of `` y '' .
