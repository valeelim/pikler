Boutique     a boutique is a small shopping outlet , especially one that specializes in elite and fashionable items such as clothing and jewellery . the word is french for `` shop '' . `` boutique '' was an everyday english word in the late 1960s when , for a brief period , swinging london was the centre of the fashion trade . carnaby street and the kings road were the focus of much media attention as the most fashionable boutiques of the era were there . today , boutique may refer to a specialised firm , such as a boutique investment bank or boutique law firm . the word is often used to describe small private hotels , to distinguish them from larger chains ( such as hilton hotels ) . in such cases the term suggest their operation is elite and highly specialised . in the strictest sense of the word , boutiques would be one-of-a-kind but some chains are referred to as boutiques if they specialize in particular styles . recently , the term `` boutique '' has started being applied to normally-mass-market items that are either niche or produced in intentionally small numbers at very high prices . this may be referred to as boutique manufacturing . for example , a `` time magazine '' article suggested that nintendo could become a `` boutique video-game company '' , producing games for niche audiences , rather than trying to compete directly with microsoft and sony .
