Off-by-one error     an off-by-one errror is a logic error that often occurs in computer programming and that often involve the checking of boundary conditions . a fencepost error ( occasionally called a telegraph pole or lamp-post error ) is a specific type of off-by-one error . the following problem illustrates the error : the intuitive answer 10 is wrong . the fence has 10 sections , but 11 posts . the reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same . the actual number of sections is one less than the number of posts . more generally , the problem can be stated as follows : the correct answer may be `` n '' âˆ’ 1 , `` n '' , or `` n '' + 1 , depending on the conditions . the precise problem definition must be carefully considered , as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations . fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them , or vice versa , or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row .
