Electric violin     an electric violin is a string instrument which is played with a bow , like a normal violin . the strings are usually tuned to the notes g , d , a , and e , but it could have its pitches changed as it is electric . it is held between the left collar bone ( near the shoulder ) and the chin . different notes are made by fingering with the left hand while bowing with the right . it has no frets or other markers . players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand and memorise them . luthiers tend to fix electric violins as well . the modern electric violin is about 10 years old . similar string instruments have been around for almost 1,000 years . it became the most enjoyable electric instrument played along with the electric bass . it is used as a solo instrument , in rock and sometimes blues . it is also used in folk music . an electric violin is normally not in the shape of a normal violin , but in wacky shapes and colours .
