Bernardo Bellotto     bernardo bellotto ( 1721 or 1722 â€“ 17 october 1780 ) was an italian urban landscape painter or `` vedutista '' , and printmaker in etching . today , he is mostly remembered for his `` vedute '' of european cities ( dresden , vienna , turin and warsaw ) . he was the pupil and nephew of canaletto and sometimes used the latter 's illustrious name , signing himself as bernardo canaletto . in germany and poland , bellotto called himself by his uncle 's name , canaletto . in his paintings , bellotto paid great attention to the way he represented works of architecture and how the light illuminated the scene . it is plausible that bellotto , and other venetian masters of `` vedute '' , may have used the camera obscura in order to achieve superior precision of urban views .
