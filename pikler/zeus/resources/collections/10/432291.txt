Fight or flight response     the fight-or-flight response ( or acute stress response ) is a set of physiological changes that occur when an animal is threatened . the changes include increased heart rate , breathing rate and blood pressure . this response was first described by w.b cannon . he found that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system . this leads to changes such as those mentioned above . the changes prepare the animal for fighting or fleeing . this response is the first stage of a general adaptation that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms . the fight or flight response lets animals respond quickly to threats . this system is universal in vertebrates . that shows it is ancient in origin , and very important . humans have some problems with the system , because though they share the physiology with other animals , they rarely face a clear-cut fight or flight choice . humans can try to talk their way through various problems and semi-threats , but they may suffer stress when the issues are not easily solved .
