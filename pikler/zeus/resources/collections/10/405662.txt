Clostridium     clostridium is a genus of bacteria . `` clostridium '' bacteria are obligate anaerobes , which means they do not need oxygen to grow . `` clostridium '' bacteria are shaped like rods . the name `` clostridium '' comes from the greek word `` kloster '' ( κλωστήρ ) , which means `` spindle . '' `` clostridium '' bacteria are gram-positive and can produce endospores . there are many different species of `` clostridium '' bacteria . some of these species can cause serious illness . `` clostridium botulinum '' bacteria make a toxin called botulinum . when botulinum toxins get into food or wounds , they cause botulism , a dangerous disease . botulism can paralyze the muscles ( stop the muscles from moving or working ) . people can die from botulism if their breathing muscles get paralyzed . this makes them unable to breathe . most cases of botulism happen because people eat meat that was not cooked well enough , or eat canned food that was not canned properly . if babies under age one eat natural honey , they can get infant botulism . most adults and older children can eat natural honey without getting sick . in healthy people , the intestines are filled with good , healthy bacteria . usually , these regular bacteria keep `` clostridium botulinum '' under control . infants do not have enough of these good bacteria to be able to eat honey safely .
