Ocean gyre     a gyre is a large system of ocean currents moving in a circle . gyres are caused by the coriolis effect . because the earth is rotating , ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to move in a clockwise direction and currents in the southern hemisphere in an anti-clockwise direction . the coriolis force acts most strongly on the wind , and the wind then creates a torque that tends to spin the ocean currents . the earth rotates from the west towards the east , and the coriolis effect becomes more intense toward the poles . because of this , gyres form strong currents on the western side of oceans , so they are pushed against the eastern coast of continents . the vorticity ( the strength of the torque force ) is balanced out by frictional surface currents , which normally act against the spin of the water . however , in the middle of the ocean , the effects of friction are very weak . the term `` gyre '' can be used to mean any type of vortex in the air or the sea , but it is most used in oceanography for the major ocean current systems .
