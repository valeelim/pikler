Sociobiology: the new synthesis    sociobiology : the new synthesis sociobiology : the new synthesis is a book by e.o . wilson that helped start the sociobiology debate , one of the great scientific controversies of the 20th century . wilson popularized the term `` sociobiology '' as an attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind behaviours such as altruism , aggression , and nurture . the fundamental principles guiding sociobiology are : 1. an organism 's evolutionary success is measured by the extent to which its genes are represented in the next generation . 1. this applies to an animal 's behaviour and social life as much as it does to any other aspect of its life . the book was first published in 1975 , then reprinted in 1976. a twenty-fifth anniversary edition was published in 2000 by harvard university press . the application of sociobiology to humans was immediately controversial . some people , such as stephen jay gould , and richard lewontin said that sociobiology was biologicially determinist . they argued that it would be used , as similar ideas had been in the past , to justify the status quo , entrench ruling elites , and legitimize authoritarian political programmes . they referred to social darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century , and to other more recent ideas , such as the race and iq controversy of the early 1970s as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society .
