Crystallinity     crystallinity is a physical property of a solid that acts like a crystal . the degree of crystallinity of a crystal has a big influence on hardness , density , transparency and diffusion . crystallinity can be measured using x-ray diffraction , but calorimetric techniques are also commonly used . examples would include : sodium chloride ( table salt )
