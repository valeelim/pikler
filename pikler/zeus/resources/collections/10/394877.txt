Locating (physics)    locating ( physics ) the act of locating something , of finding or defining the location of something , is a basic idea of modern science . in physics to say what `` to locate '' or `` location '' means , we must explain with clear talk how we do the job of locating something . for things about our size , we generally use two beginning points that everybody knows about , and then we measure from those points to the thing we want to give a location . we might start with the plymouth rock and the blarney stone . we could then say , `` captain smith 's ship is 1400 miles from plymouth rock going toward the blarney stone . '' or , in another case we might say , `` captain jones 's ship can be found by drawing a line from plymouth rock to the blarney stone , finding a point 700 miles along this line from plymouth rock , taking a left turn of 90Â° upon reaching this point from plymouth rock , and then traveling an additional 90 miles . if we have some good way of knowing compass directions , we can say something like , `` go three miles north of that big white rock over there and then go two miles east from that point . that is where i put the gold .
