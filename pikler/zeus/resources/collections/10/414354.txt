Bluebell wood     a bluebell wood is a woodland that in springtime has a carpet of flowering bluebells ( `` hyacinthoides non-scripta '' ) underneath a newly forming leaf canopy . the thicker the summer canopy , the more the ground-cover is suppressed . this encourages a dense carpet of bluebells , whose leaves mature and die down by early summer . bluebell woods may be found in all parts of great britain and ireland , as well as elsewhere in europe . bluebells are a common indicator species for ancient woodlands , so bluebell woods are likely to date back to at least 1600. gerard manley hopkins , one of the romantic poets , was very keen on bluebells , as his poem `` may magnificat '' shows . < poem > and azuring-over greybell makes wood banks and brakes wash wet like lakes < /poem > in his journal entry for 9 may 1871 hopkins says : in the little wood opposite the light they stood in blackish spreads or sheddings like spots on a snake . the heads are then like thongs and solemn in grain and grape-colour . but in the clough through the light they come in falls of sky-colour washing the brows and slacks of the ground with vein-blue , thickening at the double , vertical themselves and the young grass and brake-fern combed vertical , but the brake struck the upright of all this with winged transomes . it was a lovely sight . - the bluebells in your hand baffle you with their inscape , made to every sense . if you draw your fingers through them they are lodged and struggle with a shock of wet heads ; the long stalks rub and click and flatten to a fan on one another like your fingers themselves would when you passed the palms hard across one another , making a brittle rub and jostle like the noise of a hurdle strained by leaning against ; then there is the faint honey smell and in the mouth the sweet gum when you bite them .
