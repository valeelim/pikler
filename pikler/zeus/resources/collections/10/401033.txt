NML Cygni     nml cygni or v1489 cygni is a red hypergiant star , and one of the largest stars known at present . it is about 1,650 times the sun 's radius . it is one of the extreme luminous supergiant stars . its distance from earth is estimated to be about 5,300 light-years . this star has a dusty environment surrounding it , and it has a bean-shaped asymmetric nebula with ho vapour . it is a semiregular variable star with a period of about 940 days . nml cygni is a part of the cygnus ob2 association , which is 1.74 ± 0.2 kpc away . it is one of the closest massive associations to the sun . it was discovered in 1965 , by neugebauer , martz and leighton . the name nml comes from the names of these three discoverers . it has also been given the designation v1489 on account of the small semi-regular brightness variations caused by pulsations and mass loss . from the observations , this star has two dense envelopes of dust and molecules . the star has one of the largest mass loss rates at around 2 × 10 m per year . these dust envelopes are formed by the high mass emission rate . because of its unique position in the milky way , the star does not dominate its local interstellar environment .
