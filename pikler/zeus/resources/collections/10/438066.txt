Oncogene     an oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer . or , equally good , an oncogene is a gene which brings about uncontrolled cell division . oncogenes in tumor cells are often mutated or expressed at high levels . most normal cells undergo a programmed form of death ( apoptosis ) . activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead . most oncogenes require an additional step , such as mutations in another gene , or environmental factors , such as viral infection , to cause cancer . since the 1970s , dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer . many cancer drugs target the proteins coded by oncogenes . in 1976 j. michael bishop and harold e. varmus of the university of california , san francisco showed that oncogenes were activated proto-oncogenes , found in many organisms including humans . for this discovery bishop and varmus were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1989. the work of bishop and varmus corrected a long-standing error . the nobel citation includes this explanation :
