Computer data storage     computer data storage is the name for a number of components of a computer . the main purpose of these components is to store data . the central processing unit is then able to fetch and change the data . in most computers , there is a computer memory hierarchy : memory that is `` closer '' to the cpu is usually faster to access , but it is also smaller ; data that is stored in this kind of memory usually needs electrical power to keep the data . memory that is farther away is usually slower to access , but also bigger . examples for this kind of data are classical storage media , such as hard drives or usb flash drives . some media offer even more capacity , but accessing them is very slow . examples for such media are tape drives . modern cpus have registers that can store data , they also often have several levels of cache . finally , there is the main memory the cpu can access . these three are usually referred to as `` primary '' data storage . secondary storage is usually not directly accessible by the cpu , and data needs to be transferred to primary storage to be available . secondary storage includes hard drives and non-volatile random-access memory . tertiary storage is used for archival and backup ; very often it is copied to secondary storage before use . software is sometimes distributed by tertiary media such as magnetic tape and cd-rom .
