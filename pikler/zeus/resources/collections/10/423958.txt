King's shilling    king 's shilling the king 's shilling ( or the queen 's shilling if the monarch is female ) was the name given to a shilling that was given to soldiers who joined the british army and the royal navy as a reward for enlisting . the word is often used when talking about the 17th and 18th centuries , but the word has been used since the english civil war and is still used today . someone who said they would join the army was given the coin , but could give it back before they made a promise to a judge . once the promise was made , they were given more money . the amount of money they were given changed over the years . in 1812 , a new soldier was given Â£23 , 17 shillings and six pence . this money was a lot , which persuaded many people to join the army , but the money was spent very quickly on uniform . because this money was a lot , some people joined and deserted lots of times to get the money each time . one man was hanged in 1787 for doing this 47 times .
