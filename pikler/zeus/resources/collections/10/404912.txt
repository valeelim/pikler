Eddington limit     the eddington limit , or eddington luminosity was first worked out by arthur eddington . it is a natural limit to the normal luminosity of stars . the state of balance is a hydrostatic equilibrium . when a star exceeds the eddington limit , it loses mass with a very intense radiation-driven stellar wind from its outer layers . eddington 's models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure . eddington showed that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere . most massive stars have luminosities far below the eddington luminosity , so their winds are mostly driven by the less intense line absorption . the eddington limit explains the observed luminosity of accreting black holes such as quasars . eddington limit explains the very high mass loss rates seen in the outbursts of η carinae in 1840–1860 . the regular stellar winds can only stand for a mass loss rate of about 10–10 solar masses per year . mass loss rates of up to 0.5 solar masses per year are needed to understand the η carinae outbursts . this can be done with the help of the super-eddington broad spectrum radiation driven winds .
