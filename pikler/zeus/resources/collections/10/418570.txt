Through the Looking-Glass     through the looking-glass , and what alice found there is a children 's novel by lewis carroll . john tenniel drew the pictures . the book was published by macmillan in 1871. it is a sequel to `` alice 's adventures in wonderland '' . the book is a series of dream-like fantasy episodes . the theme which ties them together is alice 's journey as a pawn from the start of a fantasy game of chess until she reaches the eighth rank and becomes a queen . the story is about the strange world alice discovers when she passes through a looking-glass ( mirror ) above a fireplace at home . the setting is a game of chess . well known characters from the book include tweedledum and tweedledee , the walrus and the carpenter , the white knight , and the garden of live flowers . alice meets the white queen , who is very absent-minded but boasts of her ability to remember future events . alice and the white queen advance into the chessboard 's fifth rank by crossing over a stream together . at the moment of the crossing , the queen transforms into a talking sheep in a small shop . alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat , where the sheep annoys her with ( seemingly ) nonsensical shouting about `` crabs '' and `` feathers '' . unknown to alice , these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing . thus ( for a change ) the queen/sheep was speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way .
