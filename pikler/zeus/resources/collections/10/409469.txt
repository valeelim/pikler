Charles Martinet     charles martinet ( born september 17 , 1955 ) is an american actor and voice actor . he is best known as being the voice of mario in the `` mario '' series of video games since 1995. he also voices luigi , wario , waluigi , toadsworth , baby mario , baby luigi , and others . he was born in san jose , california . working for nintendo since 1994 , martinet started voicing mario at video game trade shows in which attendees would walk up to a tv screen displaying a 3-d mario head that moved around the screen and talked . this system was called `` mario in real-time '' or `` mirt '' . martinet could see the attendees by means of a hidden camera setup , and a facial motion capture rig recorded his mouth movements in order to synchronize martinet 's mouth movement with the on-screen mario mouth movement . this digital puppetry , with martinet 's comic performance , was a novelty at the time . martinet was told by his friend that there was going to be an audition at a trade show in which you `` talk to people as a plumber '' . he went to the audition at the last minute as the casting directors were already putting away their equipment . charles martinet walked in and asked , `` can i please read for this ? '' . the directors let him audition and told him , `` you 're an italian plumber from brooklyn '' . at first martinet planned to talk like a stereotypical italian american with a deep , raspy voice ( which is how mario sounded in the super `` mario bros. super show '' , '' super mario bros. 3 '' and '' super mario world '' cartoons ) . he then thought to himself that it would be too harsh for children to hear , so he made it more soft-hearted and friendly , resulting in what mario 's voice is today . martinet has also stated that he kept on talking with his mario voice until the audition tape ran out .
