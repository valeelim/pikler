Maximum likelihood     maximum likelihood estimation ( or maximum likelihood ) is the name used for a number of ways to guess the parameters of a parametrised statistical model . these methods pick the value of the parameter in such a way that the probability distribution makes the observed values very likely . the method was mainly devleoped by r.a.fisher in the early 20th century . a likelihood estimation , where probabilities are known beforehand is known as maximum a posteriori estimation .
