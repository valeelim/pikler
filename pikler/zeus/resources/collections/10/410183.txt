Header file     in computer programming , a header file can be thought of as a dictionary a compiler uses if it comes across a word it does not understand . mainly programming languages like c and c++ use this . as you may know , a computer is really powerful . but it lacks the power to think and learn . as a result , a computer has to be fed each and every instruction for a task you may want done . but it is not practical to type in each and every instruction again and again for a task , especially if you tend to use it a lot . as a solution to this , header files are used . for example , consider the word `` cout '' which is used by c++ to display outputs on the screen . the computer , however , does not know what `` cout '' is . so , it checks if `` cout '' exists in a dictionary file ( i.e . the header file ) that has been mentioned by the programmer . if it finds what to do when someone says `` cout '' , the program will be compiled properly . otherwise , it will simply result in an error that so-and-so word has not been understood by the compiler .
