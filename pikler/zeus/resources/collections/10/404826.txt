Jews as the chosen people     the jewish belief of jews as a chosen people is that jews are the chosen people of god . jews believe that god has given them a special job to repair the world . their job is to make the world a better place with more good in it . they must use the things in the world to increase good and come closer to god . they call this “ `` tikkun olam '' ” – repairing the world . jews see themselves as god ’ s partner to repair the world in any way they can – to find ways to lessen suffering of people and animals , to make more peace and respect between people , and to protect the earth ’ s environment from destruction . this idea is first found in the torah ( the first five books of the tanakh , which are also included in the christian bible ) . much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature : jews believe that god made an agreement called a “ covenant ” with abraham , the ancestor of the jewish people . the bible says that god promised to bless abraham and his descendants if they worshipped god and were faithful to him . god made this covenant with abraham 's son , isaac , and with isaac 's son , jacob . god also gave jacob another name – israel . this is how jacob ’ s descendants got the name the “ children of israel ” or “ israelites. ” god later gave the israelites the torah to the israelites through their leader , moses . the torah told the israelites how to live and build their community . god gave the israelites the ten commandments and other laws in the torah .
