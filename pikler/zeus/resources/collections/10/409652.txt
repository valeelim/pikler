Glossary of dance figures     dance figures are groups of steps which have a name , and are described in technical dance manuals . dance steps are the individual movements in a dance . a step is usually a change of weight from one leg to the other . dance patterns and dance movements are informal terms . the basic movement ( also called the basic figure or the basic step ) is the most basic movement of a dance . the music and the basic figures form the character of a dance . it is enough to do the basic steps in time with the music to dance socially . however , most social dancers can do a few more figures : one does need to turn corners . so , for example , in the waltz a social dancer would need as a minimum : closed change figures going forward and backward ; natural turn to the right ; reverse turn to the left . next would come the whisk and chass√© ( see below ) . the box step is a dance figure named so because the steps are made in the four corners of a square . it is used in some american-style ballroom dances ( rumba , waltz ) .
