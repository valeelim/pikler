Applied behavior analysis     applied behavior analysis ( aba ) is a way to help some people change their behavior . aba may also be used to find out why some behaviors have changed . aba is based on the approach to psychology known as behaviorism . aba is used as a treatment for some psychological disorders and developmental disabilities . aba is based on behavior principles that were discovered using experiments . scientific experiments and articles about aba are published in the `` journal for applied behavior analysis '' ( jaba . ) this journal was founded in 1968. in the first issue of jaba , three people wrote an article explaining what applied behavior analysis is . psychologists who study the way the environment influences behavior are called behaviorists . they study the external causes of behavior instead of a person 's feelings . a person 's feelings are internal so behaviorists think they can not be studied scientifically . psychologist john b. watson founded behaviorism in 1913 and he is regarded as one of the first psychologists to study the applied science of behavior . he thought that internal feelings should not be studied at all . he also thought that behavior is shaped by the environment over time due to the outcome of a person 's actions . he believed all behavior is learned and can be changed . if a person gets something good as a result of doing a behavior they are more likely to repeat that behavior . if something bad happens as a result of a behavior a person is less likely to do that thing again . this is an idea that is used a lot in aba .
