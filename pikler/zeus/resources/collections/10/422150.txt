Menu     a menu is a list of dishes to be served at a meal . menus have been around in europe since the 18th century . there is a special need for them in chinese cuisine because of the wide range of dishes on offer . menus have been discovered from the song dynasty in china . in the larger cities of the time , the variety of cuisine from different regions led caterers to create a list for their patrons . in restaurants , the modern menu , with dishes in a set order of courses , was invented by the great french chef escoffier . usually there are two types of menu at a good restaurant : - `` table d'hôte '' : a set menu at a fixed price ( `` prix fixée '' ) . - `` à la carte '' : a wider choice of items , each with its own price . lesser establishments might offer a chalkboard , with the advantage that items can be rubbed out or added on at short notice . fish restaurants in particular depend on daily catches being supplied or bought in the early morning . they usually list fish freshly bought ( as opposed to frozen ) . in american restaurant management , `` menu engineering '' has become a branch of marketing .
