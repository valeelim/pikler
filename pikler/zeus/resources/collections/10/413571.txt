Heliocentrism     heliocentrism is the idea that the earth and other planets revolve around the sun , which is the center of the solar system . many people proposed heliocentrism , such as aristarchus of samos from ancient greece , but nicolaus copernicus was the first to think of good reasons why it is true . this was the beginning of modern astronomy . before copernicus , most people thought that the sun and the other planets revolved around the earth ( this was called geocentrism ) . this is because if you stand on earth , it looks like the sun and stars are moving across the sky . however , when people watched for many years they saw many things that did not make sense if the earth was the center of the solar system . for example , sometimes the planets seemed to move back and forth instead of moving around the earth . copernicus explained why these things happen in 1543 , when he published the book `` de revolutionibus orbium coelestium '' ( `` on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres '' ) . this gave his reasons for thinking the sun was at the center instead .
