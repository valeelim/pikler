River Humber     the river humber is a large deep water estuary on the east coast of northern england . it is formed by the river ouse and the river trent coming together . from here to the north sea ( about 40 miles ) it forms part of the border between the east riding of yorkshire on the north side and lincolnshire on the south side . the humber 's only modern crossing is the humber bridge . at one time it the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world . now it is the fifth longest . before the bridge was built in 1981 , paddle steamers were used to cross the mile long span . in the middle ages the tides of the humber kept armies from crossing . at that time it was thought to be an arm of the ocean . during the anglo-saxon period , the humber was a major boundary , separating northumbria from the southern kingdoms . the name northumbria came from old english `` northanhymbre '' meaning `` the people north of the humber '' . the vikings used the humber and its two tributaries , the ouse and trent , with their shallow-draft longships to raid all over northeastern england .
