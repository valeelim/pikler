Hydrazone     a hydrazone is the functional group with structure rrc=nnh . they are like aldehydes or ketones , with an nnh group instead of the oxygen atom . they are made by reacting hydrazines with ketones or aldehydes : hydrazones are very useful molecules to do some reactions . for example , a ketone can be reduced down completely if made into a hydrazine and then treated with sodium ethoxide ( wolffâ€“kishner reduction ) . hydrazones are very important intermediates in many reactions , such as the fischer indole synthesis . this makes indoles , groups which are found in many drugs .
