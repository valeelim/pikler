Managed motorway     managed motorways in the united kingdom are motorways which use active traffic management . their aim is to increase traffic capacity at times of peak traffic flow . they use variable speed limits and hard shoulder running at busy times . a `` hard shoulder '' is an inner lane which in normal times is only used for emergencies . active traffic management was first used in 2005. the system is now in operation on sections of the m1 , m4 , m6 , and m42 , and there are proposals for its use on sections of the m5 , m25 , m60 and m62 . benefits include smoother traffic flows , more reliable journey times , fewer road traffic collisions , and reduced noise and harmful vehicle emissions . where only variable speed limits are used , it is called a controlled motorway .
