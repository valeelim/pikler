Nôm     nôm is a script formerly used in vietnam . it involved the use of chinese characters to write vietnamese . the van ban bell , engraved in 1076 , has the earliest known example of a nôm inscription . the earliest surviving nôm literature dates from the 13th century . the script was in common use until the 1920s . it was replaced by the vietnamese alphabet . the vietnamese alphabet is a form of the latin alphabet . classical chinese was used by the royal court and for other official purposes . the temple of literature in hanoi was the best-known school for the study of chinese . students who passed the civil service examinations could go on to become magistrates . confucian scholars saw chinese as the language of education and looked down on nôm , while popular opinion favored nôm . only a small percentage of the population was literate in any language , but nearly every village had at least one person who could read nôm . in nôm , a vietnamese word can be written using a chinese character for a word with a similar meaning or pronunciation . each character represents an idea . such characters are called `` ideographs . '' in addition , each character represents a syllable , or sound . because traditional characters have this dual property , nearly every syllable in modern vietnamese has acquired a semantic meaning . like chinese , vietnamese is a tonal language . since the issue of tone does not arise for japanese or korean , native phonetic scripts could develop for these languages without this complicating factor .
