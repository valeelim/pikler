Water organ     the water organ or hydraulic organ is a kind of pipe organ . as in the pipe organ , the sound is made by air blowing through the pipes , but power to make the air blow does not come from bellows or from electricity as in the modern organ , but from water , for example from a waterfall . a hydraulis is an early type of pipe organ that was powered by water . it was invented in the 3rd century b.c. , probably by the hellenistic scientist ctesibius of alexandria . it was the world 's first keyboard instrument . many centuries later it developed into the modern pipe organ . the water organ works by having water and air arriving together in the camera aeolis ( wind chamber ) . here , water and air separate and the compressed air is driven into a wind-trunk on top of the camera aeolis , to blow the organ pipes . two perforated ‘ splash plates ’ or ‘ diaphragms ’ stop the water spray from getting into the organ pipes . the water , having been separated from the air , leaves the camera aeolis at the same speed as it enters . it then drives a water wheel , which in turn drives the musical cylinder and the movements attached . to start the organ , the tap above the entry pipe is turned on and , given a continuous flow of water , the organ plays until the tap is closed again .
