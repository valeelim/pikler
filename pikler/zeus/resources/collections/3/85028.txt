Origin of life     the origin of life is a scientific problem which is not yet solved . there are plenty of ideas , but few clear facts . it is generally agreed that all life today evolved by common descent from a single primitive lifeform . we do not know how this early form came about , but scientists think it was a natural process which took place perhaps 3,900 million years ago . this is in accord with a philosophy called naturalism : only natural causes are admitted . we do not know whether metabolism or genetics came first . the main hypothesis which supports genetics first is rna world hypothesis , and the one which supports metabolism first is protein world hypothesis . another big problem is how cells develop . all existing forms of life are built out of cells . the nobel prize in chemistry winner melvin calvin wrote a book on the subject , and so did alexander oparin . what links most of the early work on the origin of life was the idea that before biological evolution began there must have been a process of chemical evolution . another question which has been discussed by j.d . bernal and others is the origin of the cell membrane . by concentrating the chemicals in one place , the cell membrane performs a vital function .
