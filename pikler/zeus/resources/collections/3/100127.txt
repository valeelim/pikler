C-rock     c-rock is short for chinese rock music . c-rock ( or ; literally `` chinese shaking and rolling music '' ) can be performed in any dialect of chinese language . some people consider c-rock a subgenre of c-pop . the history of c-rock before the 1980s is very unclear though it is believed to have existed in the 1970s or even the 1960s . the first clear sign of chinese rock was the 西北风 xi bei feng ( literally northwest wind ) . xi bei feng is style of folk-influenced punk music , originating from the northwestern area of china , such as the shanxi and gansu provinces . the new style was triggered by two new songs , `` 信天游 xin tian you '' and `` 一无所有 '' . as time passed , xi bei feng became stronger , more fast-tempo and aggressive . in contrast to the mellow c-pop style , xbf songs were sung loudly and forcefully . many xbf songs chanllenged political views , reflected unhappiness among chinese youth and individuality and self-empowerment . both music and lyrics articulated a sense of pride in the power of the northwest 's peasantry . songs such as `` 妹妹你大胆的往前走 '' came to represent an earthy , primordial masculine image of china , as opposed to the soft , sweet , polished urban gang tai style .
