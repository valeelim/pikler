Zoom lens     a variable focus lens ( also called zoom lens ) is a camera lens that can vary its focal length . in general , such lenses have a lower aperture than comparable fixfocus lenses . depending on the manufacturer common zoom lenses ( in the 30â€“100mm focal range , for film photography ) usually have a varying aperture , from 4 to 5.6 , perhaps 3.3 to 5.6. there are also some zoom lenses with a fixed maximal aperture ( to take the example from before : of 2.6 or 2.8 , maximum ) . in contrast , fix-focus lenses in that range have maximum apertures of 1.4 to 2. digital cameras sometimes have a function called `` digital zoom '' . this is a mathematical method which simply enlarges a part of the picture . the result is not as sharp as that of the optical zoom . when an optical zoom changes its focal length , this will also change the angle of view . digital zooms simply make a small part of an image bigger , without changing the angle of view .
