Forensic science     forensic science ( or forensics ) is when different fields of science work together to answer the questions a lawyer would ask . most often , forensics is about proving that someone was present at a place where a crime was committed . specialists take `` samples '' which are later analyzed in a laboratory . most forensic tests can take from 1 hour to one year , and investigators need to double ( and triple ) check the answer , so they know that the answer is the right answer . if a forensics team made a mistake the wrong person could be jailed , or they could get into trouble themselves . samples commonly taken include fingerprints . people also look for other things that could be used , for example a few hairs ( or pieces of skin ) . samples like hair or skin can be use for dna testing , which allows to tell the gender of the person the hair is from , amongst others . when someone is accused of committing the crime , these pieces of evidence can then be matched up . then , if they are correct , the person is charged .
