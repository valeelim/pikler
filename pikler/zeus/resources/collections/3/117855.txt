Sturgeon     sturgeon is common name for some 26 species of fish in the family acipenseridae . sturgeons have been referred to as `` living fossils '' or `` primitive fish '' because their features have stayed little changed since their earliest fossil record . sturgeon range from subtropical to subarctic waters in north america and eurasia . in north america , they range along the atlantic coast from the gulf of mexico to newfoundland . they used to be found throughout the mississippi river , the great lakes and the hudson river . throughout this extensive range , almost all species are highly threatened or vulnerable to extinction due to a combination of habitat destruction , overfishing , and pollution . in the last century , this large fish was often regarded as a nuisance because it often became entangled in and caused commercial fishing nets to become ripped . only much later did the sturgeon become prized for its meat , eggs ( caviar ) and oil . gelatin from the inner lining of its air bladder was used to make isinglass -- a substance used as a clarifying agent in jellies , glues and in the isinglass windows of carriages and early cars . nowadays , the lake sturgeon 's dark form can be sometimes be discerned in reedy shallows or near river mouths . the glimpse of it is as rare as it is startling .
