Radical (Chinese character)    radical ( chinese character ) a chinese radical ( chinese : 部首 ; pinyin : bùshǒu ; `` section header '' ) is the part of a chinese character used to list the character in a chinese dictionary . the radical is usually a semantic indicator : an indicator of the meaning of the character . this gives hints to the reader what the whole character means . later , the term was given a `` second '' meaning , the 部首 ( pinyin : `` bùshǒu '' , japanese `` bushu '' , korean `` busu '' ) . this means `` section header '' , which refers to the place where a character is listed in the dictionary . radicals are typically simpler characters , or variants of simpler characters , which combine with other radicals to form a more complex character . people can only make so many unique ideographs for the huge number of words and morphemes that make up a language . combining already existing ideographs together to form a compound ideograph is a very convenient solution to make many more words . while there are thousands of chinese characters ( well over 45,000 ) that exist , it is said that nearly all characters used in daily life are made up of just 214 radicals .
