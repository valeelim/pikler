Jeu de paume     jeu de paume was originally a french game similar to lawn tennis , but played without racquets . the players hit the ball with their hands as in volleyball . `` jeu de paume '' literally means : game of palm ( of the hand ) . after some time gloves replaced bare hands . but even when bats , and finally racquets , became standard equipment for the game , the name did not change . it became known as `` tennis '' in english ( see history of tennis ) , and later `` real tennis '' after lawn tennis became more popular than the parent game . some important buildings in france are known by the name `` jeu de paume '' , in general because they are near to tennis courts or to sites on which courts once stood . several works of art also bear this name , including the famous `` serment du jeu de paume '' ( 'the tennis court oath ' ) in the palace of versailles . it depicts the formal announcement of the french revolution made in the royal tennis court there on 20 june , 1789. sports that developed from jeu de paume . - american handball
