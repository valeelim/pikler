Transcription (genetics)    transcription ( genetics ) transcription is when rna is made from dna . the information is copied from one molecule to the other . the dna sequence is copied by a special enzyme called rna polymerase to make a matching rna strand . the matching rna strand is a 'pre-messenger rna ' . next , the non-coding introns are stripped out by a spliceosome . the remaining exons are put together to make a messenger rna . the product is called messenger rna ( mrna ) because it carries a genetic message from the dna to the protein-making machinery of the cell . transcription is the first step that leads to the expression of the genes . the stretch of dna that is transcribed into an rna molecule is called a `` transcription unit '' . this contains : 1. sequences which regulate the protein synthesis 1. sequences which do not code : introns 1. sequences which do code for amino acid sequences in the protein . they are called exons . as in dna replication , only one of the two dna strands is transcribed . this strand is called the `` template strand '' , because it provides the template for ordering the sequence of nucleotides in an rna transcript . the other strand is called the `` coding strand '' . its sequence is the same as the newly created rna transcript ( except for thymine being substituted for uracil ) .
