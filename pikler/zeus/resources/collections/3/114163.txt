Aude     aude is a department in the region of occitanie in southern france . it is named after the aude river . the inhabitants of the aude are known , in french , as `` audois '' ( women : `` audoises '' ) . aude was created in 1790 during the french revolution , when the whole of france was divided into departments , replacing the old provinces . aude was formed with part of the old province of languedoc . it was divided in six districts : castelnaudary , carcassonne , narbonne , lagrasse , limoux and quillan , with carcassonne as is capital . in 1800 , with the creation of the `` arrondissements '' in france , the six districts were changed into four `` arrondissements '' : carcassonne , castelnaudary , limoux and narbonne . on 10 september 1926 , the `` arrondissement '' of castelnaudary was eliminated . a skull was found , and named `` homme de tautavel '' ( tautavel man ) . it was found in a cave on the site called caune de l'arago , near tautavel . the fossils are between 300.000 and 450.000 years old . there are over 80 fragments ; the skull belonged to a man in his twenties . he was about 1.65 m , and weighed around 45â€“55 kg . other remains are two mandibles , belonging to a woman in her fifties , and to a man , about 20 to 25 years old . it looks like they did not know how to use fire yet . it also looks like they might have been cannibals , or that they preferred to scavenge for food , rather than hunt . some bones of rhinoceros , horses , wild sheep ( called mouflon ) , tahrs ( resemble wild goats ) , muskox ( a type of bovine ) , deer , and reindeer were found in the cave . there is an ongoing debate if this hominian is directly related to the neanderthal . if they are not they would be homines erecti ( currently they are classified as h. erectus tautavelensis ) . if they are direct predecessors of the neanderthals , they would be homo heidelbergensis .
