Inductive reasoning     induction is one of the main forms of logical reasoning . the other is deduction . in induction , we find a general rule by using a large number of particular cases . for example , watching water in many different situations , we can conclude that water always flows downhill . induction is not the method of science , but it can be the starting-point for science . everyone can see that the sun , moon and stars appear to move across the sky . early civilisations thought this meant they revolved around the earth , because that is what they always seem to do . we now know this is quite wrong , but discovering the real explanation was the start of modern science ( see copernicus , galileo and heliocentrism ) . what they did was to work out an alternative theory or hypothesis , which eventually was shown to be a much better explanation of all the observations . that is real science , but the observations of the heavens , which started with the babylonians , showed the regularity which needed to be explained . what science did was to prove the obvious explanation was not the right one .
