Capitol Records     capitol records is a record label based in hollywood , california . it was founded in 1942 by musician johnny mercer , with partners buddy desylva and glenn wallichs . the company was later bought by emi , a company based in england . the buyout gave capitol 's american recording artists an outlet for their records in england and europe , while emi 's artists could sell their works in america . capitol 's biggest-selling `` imported '' artist is the beatles . when the beatles had their first hits in england and europe , capitol records did not want to market their recordings . record producer george martin turned instead to other american labels , trying to give the beatles a hit record in america . their records did not sell well in america at first , but `` i want to hold your hand '' became a hit through radio airplay of a british copy . capitol records changed their minds , released `` i want to hold your hand '' , and it became a best-seller . capitol then became the exclusive record label for the beatles in america . when universal music sold parlophone ( the beatles ' british label ) to warner music group , universal moved the beatles ' music to capitol records worldwide .
