Kush     kush civilization had its center in the region of nubia . this was in northern sudan of today . we know about it through the egyptians who moved south around 2500 bc . when the middle kingdom of egypt ended an independent kingdom of kush developed . about 1500 bc egyptians moved southwards again , but this time met organized resistance . historians are not sure whether this resistance came from many city states or a single unified empire . the egyptians won , and the region became a colony of egypt under the control of thutmose i. the region supplied egypt with resources . in the eleventh century bc internal disputes in egypt caused colonial rule to collapse and an independent kingdom based at napata in nubia . this kingdom was ruled by locals who overthrew the colonial regime . but kush had many beliefs and gods in common with egypt . the name given this civilization comes from the old testament where cush ( hebrew : כוש ) was one of the sons of ham ( son of noah ) who settled in northeast africa . the bible refers to cush on a number of occasions . moses wife , tzipporah , is described as a kushite in the book of numbers .
