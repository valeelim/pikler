Rip current     a rip current is a strong surface flow of water returning seaward from near the shore ( not to be confused with an undertow ) . it is often mistakenly called a `` rip tide '' or `` riptide '' , though the occurrence is not related to the tides . colloquially a rip current is known simply as a rip . although rip currents would exist even without the tides , tides can make an existing rip much more dangerous ( especially low tide ) . typical flow is at 0.5 meters per second ( 1-2 feet per second ) , and can be as fast as 2.5 meters per second ( 8 feet per second ) . rip currents can move to different locations on a beach break , up to tens of metres ( a few hundred feet ) a day . they can happen at any beach with breaking waves , including the world 's oceans , seas , and large lakes such as the great lakes in canada and the united states . other websites . - rip current safety ( us national weather service ) - united states lifesaving association , rip currents - rip currents - everything a swimmer needs ( pictures too ) on just one page
