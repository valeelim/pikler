Ungdomshuset     ungdomshuset ( in english : `` the youth house '' ) was the popular name of the building formally named folkets hus ( `` house of the people '' ) on jagtvej 69 in nørrebro , copenhagen . the ungdomshuset was a meet point for many anarchists , for the music in the underground scene and leftist groups from 1982 until 2007 , when after a long conflict between the municipal government of copenhagen and the people living there , was smashed . police started to clear the building early on thursday , 1 march 2007. demolition began on 5 march 2007 and was completed two days later . ever since the eviction in march 2007 , former users and supporters have held weekly demonstrations for a new ungdomshuset , the demonstrations starting from nearby square 'blågårds plads ' every thursday at 5 p.m. and going to various places in copenhagen . the starting point has recently been changed to gammel torv in response to the demonstraters saying they are getting closer to the politicians concerning a solution for a new ungdomshus at an old school.in the summer of 2007 , an iniative known as g13 wanted to squat an old public waterwork on grøndalsvænge allé 13 in northwestern copenhagen to be used as a new ungdomshuset , the squat was non-violent , but was met with heavy opposition from the police who arrested 436 people and threw large amounts of tear gas
