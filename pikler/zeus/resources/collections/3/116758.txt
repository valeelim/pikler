Illegal prime     an illegal prime is a special prime number . such prime numbers are called illegal , because there is a way to change them , so that they yield something illegal : a program to circumvent the digital millennium copyright act . one of the first people to find such a prime was phil camody . in 2001 , he found a prime that contains the gzip compressed source code for a program that can circumvent the content scrambling system . the content scrambling system is used as a way to prevent dvds from being copied . later , other primes were found that resulted in directly runnable programs . the united states and other countries made it illegal to publish or circulate computer programs that can circumvent copy protection . since prime numbers are a concept from mathematics , their knowledge can not be made illegal easily . any information that can be represented in binary form can be represented as a number .
