Cymbospondylus     cymbospondylus was a large but primitive triassic ichthyosaur of the middle and upper triassic . it had a long eel-like body up to 10 meters or more in length . `` cymbospondylus '' is known from both germany and nevada . no doubt , like other large marine reptiles and present-day aquatic mammals , it had a wide oceanic distribution . `` cymbospondylus '' was one of the largest ichthyosaurs . fossils ranging from long . it was also one of the least fish-like of the ichthyosaurs , lacking a dorsal fin and fluked tail . it did , however , have an elongated snout like other ichthyosaurs . the one metre long head of `` cymbospondylus '' , with large jaws , contained rows of teeth adapted for catching and holding on to fish , belemnites , and cephalopods such as ammonites . the long tail would have been excellent for swimming , and allowed `` cymbospondylus '' to move at fast speeds and efficiently hunt down shoals of swimming fish . adult `` cymbospondylus '' probably spent much of their time hunting in deep offshore water , only coming into shallow water to breed or to catch seasonally available prey . like other ichthyosaurs , `` cymbospondylus '' probably gave birth to live young , as it had no way to lay eggs . these , on reaching adult size , probably had few , if any , predators that could harm them .
