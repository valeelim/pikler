121 Hermione     121 hermione is a very big asteroid of the dark c spectral type , orbiting in the cybele group in the farther part of the main belt . as a c-type , it is probably made of carbonate . hermione was found by j. c. watson on may 12 , 1872 , and named after hermione , daughter of menelaus and helen in greek mythology . hermione is a cybele asteroid and orbits beyond most of the main belt asteroids . the asteroid has an odd shape , as evidenced by adaptive optics images , the first of which were taken in december 2003 , with the keck telescope . of many proposed shape models that agreed with the images , a `` snowman '' -like shape was found to best fit the seen precession rate of hermione 's moon . observation of the moon 's orbit has made possible a correct determination of hermione 's mass . for the best-fit `` snowman '' model , the density is found to be 1.8 ± 0.2 g/cm³ . this gives a porosity of the order of 20 % . this could be because the main asteroids are fractured solid bodies , but not a rubble pile ( an asteroid that has been broken up by a collision and pulled back together by gravity ) .
