Specific gravity     specific gravity ( sg ) is a special case of relative density . it is defined as the ratio of the density of a given substance , to the density of water ( ho ) . substances with a specific gravity greater than 1 are heavier than water , and those with a specific gravity of less than 1 are lighter than water . formula_1 sg is by definition dimensionless and therefore not dependent on the system of units used ( e.g . slugsft or kgm ) , insofar as the units are consistent . based on the sg-value of a given substance , the density of that substance can be calculated . related pages . - buoyancy - fluid mechanics - relative density references . - `` fundamentals of fluid mechanics '' wiley , b.r . munson , d.f . young & t.h . okishi - `` introduction to fluid mechanics '' fourth edition , wiley , si version , r.w . fox & a.t. mcdonald - `` thermodynamics : an engineering approach '' second edition , mcgraw-hill , international edition , y.a . cengel & m.a . boles
