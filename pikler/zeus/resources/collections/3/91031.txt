German car number plates     german car number plates ( `` kfz-kennzeichen '' ) show the place where the car carrying them is registered . when a person changes their main home in germany , or buys a new car , they must buy new number plates . number plates can be bought which are valid all year round or between 2 to 11 months within any 12 months . this allows changing between summer and winter cars , such as a convertible and a sedan/saloon without having the time and money wasted for de- and re-registering . the present number plate format , used since 1994 , uses black print on a white background and first provides information about the country where the car is registered within the european union . german licence plates show a `` d '' ( for `` deutschland '' = '' germany '' ) on the blue strip on the left , which shows the european union 's flag , 12 golden stars in a circle on blue ground . after that , there are between one and three letters for the city or region where the car is registered , such as b for berlin . these units usually coincide with the german districts , in few cases an urban district and the surrounding district share the same letter code . usually if an urban district and a rural district share the code , the number of the following letters is different . for example , the urban district ( straubing ) sr has one letter after the code ( sr - a 123 ) . the surrounding district straubing-bogen has two letters ( sr - ab 123 ) after the code . it depends on the number of registered cars ( or citizens ) whether the city or the district has two letters , because there are more possibilities with two letters , so the part with more citizens usually has two letters . for example , the urban district regensburg has more citizens than the rural district regensburg , so the city has two letters after the code r .
