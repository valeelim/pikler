Vorticity     vorticity is a mathematical concept used in fluid dynamics . it can be related to the amount of `` circulation '' or `` rotation '' ( or more strictly , the local angular rate of rotation ) in a fluid . the average vorticity in a small region of fluid flow is equal to the circulation formula_1 around the boundary of the small region , divided by the area a of the small region . notionally , the vorticity at a point in a fluid is the limit as the area of the small region of fluid approaches zero at the point : mathematically , the vorticity at a point is a vector and is defined as the curl of the velocity : one of the base assumptions of the potential flow assumption is that the vorticity formula_5 is zero almost everywhere , except in a boundary layer or a stream-surface immediately bounding a boundary layer . because a vortex is a region of concentrated vorticity , the non-zero vorticity in these specific regions can be modelled with vortices . further reading . - batchelor , g. k. , ( 1967 , reprinted 2000 ) `` an introduction to fluid dynamics '' , cambridge univ . press
