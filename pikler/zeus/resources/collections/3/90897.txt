User interface     a user interface allows a user to interact with a machine . user interfaces mainly provide two things : - input the user can change things ; he or she can change how the machine works , or give more information to the machine . - output after the user has given some input , the machine will do something , and then provide some output many machines can be very dangerous . a machine should have a user interface that can be handled easily , even if the person operating the machine has panicked . the user interface should therefore be intuitive , and simple to use . an example of such a user interface is that of the kill switch . a kill switch must shut off the machine at all costs - the idea is to avoid injury or harm to people . this is very different from shutting off the machine at the end of the shift , or when it is no longer needed . according to en iso 13850 , the kill switch has to be red on a yellow background . the colors used to mark different states are close to those used by signals used on the road .
