Old Faithful Geyser     old faithful is a cone geyser in wyoming , in yellowstone national park in the united states . old faithful was named in 1870 during the washburn-langford-doane expedition and was the first geyser in the park to get a name . eruptions can shoot 3,700 to 8,400 u.s. gallons ( 14–32 kl ) of boiling water to a height of 106–184 feet ( 30–55 m ) lasting from 1.5 to 5 minutes . the average height of an eruption is 145 feet ( 44 m ) . eruptions often occur about 90 minutes away from each other , but this difference in time can range from 45 to 125 minutes on occasion . more than 137,000 eruptions have been recorded . harry m. woodward first described a mathematical relationship between the duration and intervals of the eruptions ( 1938 ) . old faithful is not the highest or biggest geyser in the park ; that title belongs to the less predictable steamboat geyser . over the years , the length of the difference of time has increased , which may be the result of earthquakes changing underground water levels . these disruptions have made the earlier mathematical relationship inaccurate , but have in fact made old faithful more predictable . with an error of 10 minutes , old faithful will erupt 65 minutes after an eruption lasting less than 2.5 minutes or 92 minutes after an eruption lasting more than 2.5 minutes . the reliability of old faithful can be attributed to the fact that it is not connected to any other thermal features of the upper geyser basin .
