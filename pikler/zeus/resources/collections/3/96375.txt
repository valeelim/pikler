Perspective (graphical)    perspective ( graphical ) in graphic arts , perspective is the representation of how an image is seen by the eye . it is about how the angle and distance of a three-dimensional object is represented on a flat surface . to create a real scene , objects are drawn smaller to show that they are farther away from the person looking at the artwork . the dimensions of an object are also drawn differently depending where the line of sight is . the size of an object 's dimensions along the line of sight are usually drawn shorter than dimensions across the line of sight . this is called foreshortening , and is used to create the appearance of three dimensions on a flat surface . landscape paintings have a horizon line . this line represents objects that are infinitely far away . they have shrunk , in the distance , like objects on the earth 's horizon . changing the height of the horizon level changes the view point for the picture . a person lying on the ground and looking up would have a different view to a person on a ladder looking down .
