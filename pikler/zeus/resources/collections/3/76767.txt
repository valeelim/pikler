Grand duchy     a grand duchy is a country whose head of state is a grand duke or grand duchess . the only grand duchy in existence today is luxembourg . luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 when the netherlands became an independent kingdom , and king william i of the netherlands was made grand duke of luxembourg . in 1890 the two countries separated . william iii of the netherlands had no male heir , so in the netherlands he was succeeded by queen wilhelmina but luxembourg followed salic law , which meant only a man could rule . the present grand duke of luxembourg is henri . however there are other houses of europe that style themselves as grand dukes even if not wholly recognised by the rest of society . the independent republics of finland and lithuania , and the dutch province limburg ( duchy of limburg ) have been grand duchies at certain times in their history . the title grand duke ( latin : `` magnus dux '' , german : `` großherzog '' , italian : `` gran duca '' , french : `` grand-duc '' , swedish : `` storhertig '' , lithuanian : '' didysis kunigaikštis '' , polish : `` wielki książę '' , czech : `` velkovévoda '' ) ranks in honour below king but higher than a sovereign duke ( `` herzog '' ) or prince ( `` fürst '' ) .
