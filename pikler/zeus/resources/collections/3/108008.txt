Archaeological site     an archeological site is a place where archaeologists work . usually , evidence has been found ( or is suppposed to be there ) of a previous cultural achievement . the archeologists working there will classify what they find . they may also change the site so that what has been found can be preserved better . the site will have trenches so that people can excavate better . to start the excavation , the topsoil will be removed . special tools like pickaxes and mattocks are used to break up and remove very hard compacted soil . shovels and spades are used to clear away bulk debris . other hand tools used in bulk cleanup work are hoes , rakes , forks , and the wheelbarrow to cart it away . in some circumstances , all of the soil will be fine sieved , from the wheelbarrow , before being dumped into a waste area .
