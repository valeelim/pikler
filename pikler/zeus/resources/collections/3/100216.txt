Somatosensory system     the 'somatosensory system ' is a sensory system that detects experiences labelled as touch or pressure , temperature ( warm or cold ) , pain ( including itch and tickle ) and those that belong to proprioception . these are the sensations of muscle movement and joint position including posture , movement , visceral ( internal ) senses and facial expression . visceral senses have to do with sensory information from within the body , such as stomach aches . touch may be considered one of five human senses ; however , when a person touches something or somebody this gives rise to various feelings : the perception of pressure ( shape , softness , texture , vibration , etc . ) , relative temperature and sometimes pain . thus the term `` touch '' is actually the combined term for several senses . in medicine , the colloquial term `` touch '' is usually replaced with somatic senses , to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved . other pages . - proprioception references . - flanagan , j.r. , lederman , s.j . neurobiology : feeling bumps and holes , news and views , nature , 2001 jul . 26 ; 412 ( 6845 ) :389-91 .
