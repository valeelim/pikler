Archaeognatha     archaeognatha is an order of wingless insects , also known as `` jumping bristletails '' . they are among those insects which changed least during evolution . they first appear in the devonian period along with the arachnids ( spiders ) . the name archaeognatha is derived from greek `` archaeos '' meaning `` ancient '' and `` gnatha '' meaning `` jaw '' . this refers to the articulation of the mandibles , which has a single condyle , where all higher insects have two . an alternate name , `` microcoryphia '' comes from the greek `` micro '' meaning `` small '' and `` coryphia '' meaning head . the order archaeognatha has previously been combined with the order thysanura , or bristletails . both groups have three-pronged tails with two cerci and an epiproct . archaeognatha differ from thysanura in that they are able to use their tail to spring up to 30 cm into the air . like thysanura , the body is covered with scales , with a thin exoskeleton that is susceptible to dehydration . there are approximately 350 species in the two families . they are distributed worldwide , and unusual in the insect world in that they can even be found in the arctic where they live in leaf litter and rock crevices . they feed primarily on algae , but also lichens , mosses , or decaying organic materials .
