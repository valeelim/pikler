Pendulum     a pendulum is a mass ( any object , usually metal ) on an arm . the arm is attached to a `` pivot '' , which is a point to swing from . the mass will naturally hang down because of gravity , but if it is pushed to one side it will `` oscillate '' , which means that it will swing from side to side . the frequency of the swinging pendulum stays the same . we can work out the time taken for one full oscillation ( for example swinging from left to right and back to left . we will call this time t. if the pendulum length is `` l '' , and the acceleration of gravity is g , then : formula_1 where Ï€ is read 'pi ' . note that the period of a pendulum does not depend on the mass of the object . the mechanical energy of a pendulum is constant and is the sum of the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy . the regular motion of the pendulum can be used for time keeping , and pendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks .
