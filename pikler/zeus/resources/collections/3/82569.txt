15 Eunomia     15 eunomia is a very big asteroid in the closer part of the main asteroid belt . it is the biggest of the stony ( s-type ) asteroids , and somewhere between the 8th to 12th biggest main belt asteroid overall ( unsure diameters make its ranking unsure ) . it is also the biggest member of the eunomia family of asteroids . eunomia was found by annibale de gasparis on july 29 , 1851 and named after eunomia , one of the horae ( hours ) , a personification of order and law in greek mythology . as the biggest s-type asteroid ( with 3 juno being a very close second ) , eunomia has attracted a moderate amount of scientific attention . it has a bit over one percent of the mass of the entire main belt . eunomia appears to be a stretched but fairly round body , with what appear to be four sides of differing curvature and noticeably different average compositions . its stretched shape led to the suggestion that eunomia may be a binary object . however , this has been denied . it is a retrograde rotator with its pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( -65° , 2° ) with a 10° uncertainty . this gives an axial tilt of about 165° .
