Inverter     an inverter is an electric apparatus that changes direct current ( dc ) to alternating current ( ac ) . it is not the same thing as an alternator , which converts mechanical energy ( e.g . movement ) into alternating current . direct current is created by devices such as batteries and solar panels . when connected , an inverter allows these devices to provide electric power for small household devices . the inverter does this through a complex process of electrical adjustment . from this process , ac electric power is produced . this form of electricity can be used to power an electric light , a microwave oven , or some other electric machine . an inverter usually also increases the voltage . in order to increase the voltage , the current must be decreased , so an inverter will use a lot of current on the dc side when only a small amount is being used on the ac side . inverters are made in many different sizes . they can be as small as 150 watts , or as large as 1 megawatt ( 1 million watts ) . types . - sine wave inverters produce good-quality ac power . they are expensive .
