Richard Cromwell     richard cromwell ( 4 october 1626 â€“ 12 july 1712 ) was the third son of oliver cromwell , and the second lord protector of england , scotland and ireland , for little over eight months , from 3 september 1658 until 25 may 1659. richard cromwell 's enemies called him `` tumbledown dick '' and `` queen dick '' . richard cromwell was not suited to ruling the country . he followed his father as ruler only because he was oliver 's oldest surviving son , and people expected one of oliver 's sons to follow him . after a short time , he gave up power and he knew that many of the people wanted king charles ii to return from holland and rule the country . when it was agreed that charles would return , richard thought it would be best for him to leave britain , and he went to live in france for a while . he changed his name to `` john clarke '' and travelled around europe , not returning home for twenty years . when he came back , he lived quietly outside london for the rest of his life . it is possible that the nursery rhyme `` hickory dickory dock '' is actually about richard cromwell . one of richard 's nicknamess was hickory dick . the mouse in the rhyme runs down when the clock strikes one and cromwell only reigned for one year .
