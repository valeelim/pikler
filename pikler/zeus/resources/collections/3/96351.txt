Yagan     yagan ( c. 1795–11 july 1833 ) was a noongar warrior who played an important part in early indigenous australian resistance to european settlement and rule in the area of perth , western australia . yagan was the son of midgigoroo , one of the elders of the tribe who lived in the perth area . yagan was blamed for spearing cattle near the swan river . there were not many cattle in the new colony and food was scarce . yagan 's taking of the settlers animals and food supplies was seen as a very serious crime . after a european was killed , the military started a search for yagan . he was found after four months and sent to carnac island . he escaped after six weeks . one of the soldiers who had got to know him on carnac island , compared him to william wallace . yagan 's brother was killed in april 1833 while trying to steal flour from a cart . yagan , midgigoroo and several others attacked another cart and killed the drivers . they were declared outlaws , which meant they had no legal rights and could be killed by anyone . a reward of £30 was offered for their capture . midgigoroo was soon captured and executed . two months later , on 11 july 1833 a shepherd , william keates , shot and killed yagan . keates was killed soon afterwards in another fight with the aborigines , and his brother claimed the reward for the capture of yagan . yagan 's head was cut off and sent to england for display .
