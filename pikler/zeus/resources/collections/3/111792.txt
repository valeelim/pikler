Energy level     simply defined as the different states of potential energy for electrons in an atom . a quantum mechanical system can only be in certain states , so that only certain energy levels are possible . the term energy level is most commonly used in reference to the electron configuration in atoms or molecules . in other words , the energy spectrum can be quantized ( see continuous spectrum for the more general case ) . as with classical potentials , the potential energy is usually set to zero at infinity , leading to a negative potential energy for bound electron states . energy levels are said to be degenerate , if the same energy level is obtained by more than one quantum mechanical state . they are then called degenerate energy levels . the following sections of this article gives an overview over the most important factors that determine the energy levels of atoms and molecules . assume an electron in a given atomic orbital . the energy of its state is mainly determined by the electrostatic interaction of the ( negative ) electron with the ( positive ) nucleus . the energy levels of an electron around a nucleus are given by :
