Book of Numbers     the book of numbers in the bible is the fourth book in the old testament . it is called a book of moses because it contains the story of moses and the israelites when they wander throughout the wilderness before ending up at israel ( also known as canaan or palestine ) , where god promised they will settle . the book is called numbers because at the start god ordered a counting of the people ( a census ) in the twelve tribes of israel . after counting all the men who are over twenty and fit to fight , the israelites began to travel in well-ordered divisions , with god in the middle of the ark of the covenant . in hebrew , the book is called bmidbar , which means 'in a desert , ' because it is the account of their 40 years of wandering therein . when the people found that the place god promised them was filled with strong and powerful people of other races , they became scared and rebelled against god and moses . therefore , god punished them by making the israelites travel forty years before they could settle on the promised land .
