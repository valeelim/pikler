Armistice     an armistice is the effective end of a war , when the parties agree to stop fighting . the word comes from the latin `` arma '' , meaning weapons and `` statium '' , meaning a stopping . a truce or ceasefire usually refers to a `` temporary '' stop of hostilities for an agreed limited time or within a limited area . a truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice . an armistice is not the same as a peace treaty , which may take months or even years to agree on . the 1953 korean war armistice is a major example of an armistice which has not yet been followed by a peace treaty . the united nations security council often demands cease-fire of parties in modern conflicts . armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than un cease-fire resolutions in modern international law . the most famous armistice is the armistice with germany at the end of world war i , on 11 november , 1918 , signed near compi√®gne , france , and effective at the `` eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month .
