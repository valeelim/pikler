Parts of speech     parts of speech are types of word in grammar . there are many different word : they are called 'lexical categories ' . the most common are these : verbs , nouns , adjectives , adverbs , and interjections are called open classes because they are parts of speech that can easily add new words . on the other hand , pronouns , prepositions , and conjunctions are closed classes because new words can not be added easily . for example , since pronouns are a closed class , there are fairly few pronouns : i , me , my , mine , myself , you , you , your , yours , yourself , he , him , his , his , himself , she , her , her , hers , herself , it , it , its , its , itself , we , us , our , ours , ourselves , they , them , their , theirs , themselves . since pronouns are used to replace whole noun phrases , there is no need to have many kinds of pronouns . instead of saying `` the earl of sandwich introduced the earl of sandwich 's favorite food , the sandwich '' , one uses the pronoun `` his '' to replace `` the earl of sandwich 's '' to make the sentence not repeat itself when it does n't have to , thus the sentence becomes `` the earl of sandwich introduced his favorite food , the sandwich '' . new nouns , on the other hand , can easily be made , and are constantly being added into the english language .
