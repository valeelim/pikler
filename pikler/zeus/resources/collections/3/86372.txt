Maltese people     the maltese people , or maltese , are a nation and ethnic group native to malta , an island country made of a group of seven islands in the mediterranean sea . people have lived in malta since around 5200 bc with the first people living there coming from sicily . an important prehistoric neolithic culture marked by megalithic structures was on the islands , which were made a thousand years before the pyramids of giza , which means they were very old . the phoenicians in the mediterranean took over malta from about 1000 bc , using the islands to expand their sea explorations and trade in the mediterranean , until the carthaginians took over and also expanded in the mediterranean , but these were also defeated by the romans in 216 bc . malta was then ruled by byzantine , a greek group that took over almost all of the mediterranean , from the 4th to 9th century . sometime around this point , the vandals , a german tribe , ruled the islands . the islands were at one point invaded by the arabs in ad 870. they allowed the people to believe in christianity , and did not have children with the population , so they did not change much on the island , but they showed them citrus fruits and cotton , and water-moving systems . they hardly had any effect on the island or its people while they were there , but one thing that they did effect was the language . the maltese language gained a lot from this .
