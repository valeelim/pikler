Henry Willis     henry willis ( born : 27 april 1821 , london - died : 11 february 1901 , london ) was a british builder of pipe organs . he built a very large number of organs , many of them for big cathedrals and concert halls in britain , such as st. paul 's cathedral , truro cathedral , and the royal albert hall . he also built an organ for queen victoria at windsor castle . many of the organs that he built are in other parts of the world , especially in countries that belonged to the british empire . many organists who gave organ recitals liked henry willis ’ s organs because they had lots of different sounds which helped to make the organ sound like an orchestra . he made organs for churches where the architects were getting rid of the central screen so that the organ could be heard better in the main part of the church ( the nave ) . he used ideas that had been created by the french organ builder cavaillé-coll and by barker . he made several inventions himself , including the thumb piston , which made it possible for an organist to change the combination of stops without taking his hands off the keyboard .
