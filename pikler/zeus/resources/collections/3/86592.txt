Olfactory system     the olfactory system is the sensory system used for olfaction or the sense of smell . most mammals and reptiles have two parts to their olfactory system . 1. there is a main olfactory system , which detects volatile , airborne substances . 1. there is secondary , or accessory , system . the accessory olfactory system senses fluid-based stimuli . behavioral evidence indicates that most often , the stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system are pheromones . the olfactory system is often spoken as being similar to the gustatory system ( taste system ) . both are chemosensory senses . they change chemical signals into nerve impulses , which are translated into perceptions in the brain . the part of the brain which deals with olfaction is the rhinencephalon , a small part in the human brain , but much more important in other vertebrates . the piriform cortex is probably the area most closely associated with identifying the odor . the medial amygdala is involved in social functions such as mating and recognising animals of the same species . the entorhinal cortex pairs odors with memories . the exact functions of these higher areas is still being researched .
