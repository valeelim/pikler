Cockroach     the cockroach is an insect of the suborder blattaria of the order blattodea . there are 4,000 species . about 30 species invade human homes . this is less than 1 % of all the cockroach species . four species are pests . the families of mantodea , isoptera , and blattaria are usually combined by entomologists into a larger group called dictyoptera . current evidence strongly suggests that termites have evolved directly from true cockroaches , and many authors now consider termites to be in the family of cockroaches . historically , the name blattaria has been used largely interchangeably with the name blattodea . blattodea refers to a larger group that includes fossil groups related to roaches , but not true cockroaches themselves . these earliest cockroach-like fossils ( `` blattopterans '' or `` roachids '' ) are from the carboniferous period between 354â€“295 million years ago . however , these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantis as well as modern cockroaches . the first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appear in the lower cretaceous .
