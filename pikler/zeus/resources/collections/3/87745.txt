Daikokuten     in japan , daikokuten ( 大黒天 ) , is one of the seven lucky gods . daikokuten came from the indian god , shiva . daikoku wears japanese robes and has a happy and smiling personality . daikoku 's pictures are found in the temples of tibet and china and the god enjoys a high position as a household god in japan . daikoku 's connection with wealth and success started a strange ritual known as fuku-nusubi . this ritual started with the belief that the person who stole figures of gods and goddesses was promised good luck , if they were not caught while stealing . eventually , stealing divine figures became so common that the toshi-no-ichi or the ‘ year-end-market ’ held in the asakusa kannon temple became the main place where the sale of these images was held . daikoku is considered to be the god of wealth or the household , mostly the kitchen . he is recognised from his wide face , smile , and a flat black hat . he is often shown holding a golden mallet and sitting on bales of rice . references . - japan and indian asia by hajime nakamura . publisher : firma klm , 1961. publication date : 1961
