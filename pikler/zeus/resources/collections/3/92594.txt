IC50     the ic is a measure of how effective a drug is . it indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance is needed to inhibit a given biological process ( or component of a process , i.e . an enzyme , cell , cell receptor or microorganism ) by half . in other words , it is the half minimal ( 50 % ) inhibitory concentration ( ic ) of a substance ( 50 % ic , or ic ) . it is commonly used as a measure of antagonist drug potency in pharmacological research . sometimes , it is also converted to the pic scale ( -log ic ) , in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency . according to the fda , ic represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50 % inhibition `` in vitro '' . it is comparable to an ec for agonist drugs . ec also represents the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50 % of a maximum effect `` in vivo '' .
