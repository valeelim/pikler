Mudflow     a mudflow or mudslide occurs when mud travels down a slope very quickly . mudflows , which are like giant moving mud pies , happen when lots of water mixes with soil and rock . the water makes the slippery mass of mud flow quickly down . mudflows happen most in mountainous places where a long dry season is followed by heavy rains . mudflows of volcanic eruptions are the most dangerous , and are called lahars . a lahar is a type of mudflow or debris flow composed of a slurry of pyroclastic material , rocky debris , and water . the material flows down from a volcano , typically along a river valley . lahars can move as quickly as 80km/h and are as thick as liquid concrete . lahars have several possible causes : - snow and glaciers can be melted by lava or pyroclastic flows during an eruption - a flood caused by a glacier , lake breakout , or heavy rainfall can release a lahar , also called glacier run - water from a crater lake , combined with volcanic material in an eruption lahars can occur without volcanic activity , if conditions are right for the collapse and movement of mud from existing volcanic ash deposits .
