490 Veritas     490 veritas is a big asteroid , which may have been involved in one of the more huge asteroid-asteroid collisions of the past 100 million years . at 115 and 125 km in diameter , veritas and 92 undina are the biggest of the 300-strong veritas family of asteroids . david nesvorn√Ω of the southwest research institute in boulder traced the orbits of these bodies back in time , and calculated that they formed in a collision of a body at least 150 km in diameter with a smaller asteroid some 8 million years ago . veritas and undina would have been the biggest pieces of that collision . the thought veritas collision would have been too far from jupiter for the pieces to have been slung into a collision course with earth . however , solar radiation would have caused the resulting dust to drift inward to earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment . today continuing collisions among veritas-family asteroids are estimated to send five thousand tons of cosmic dust to earth each year , 15 % of the total .
