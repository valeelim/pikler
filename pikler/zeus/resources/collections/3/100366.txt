Dimensionless quantity     in dimensional analysis , a dimensionless quantity ( or more precisely , a quantity with the dimensions of 1 ) is a quantity without any physical units and thus a pure number . such a number is typically defined as a product or ratio of quantities which do have units , in such a way that all the units cancel out . `` out of every 10 apples i gather , 1 is rotten . '' -- the rotten-to-gathered ratio is ( 1 apple ) / ( 10 apples ) = 0.1 = 10 % , which is a dimensionless quantity . there are infinitely many dimensionless quantities and they are often called numbers . some of those that are used most often have been given names , as in the following list of examples ( alphabetical order ) : other websites . - biographies of 16 scientists with dimensionless numbers of heat and mass transfer named after them - how many fundamental constants are there ? by john baez - michael sheppard , systematic search for expressions of dimensionless constants using the nist database of physical constants , 2007
