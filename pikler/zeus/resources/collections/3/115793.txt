Flannel     flannel is a soft woven fabric , of various fineness . it usually does not have a nap , and instead gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn it is woven from . it is commonly used to make clothing , bed sheets , and sleepwear . flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn , but is now often made from either wool and cotton , or wool and synthetic fibre . flannelette is a light , napped cotton fabric imitating the texture of flannel . the weft is generally coarser than the warp . the flannel-like appearance is created by creating a nap from the weft ; scratching it and raising it up . flannelette can either have long or short nap , and can be napped on only one or two sides . it comes in many colours , both solid and patterned . flannel , flannelette and cotton flannel can be woven in either a twill weave or plain weave . the weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides . after weaving , it is napped once , then bleached , dyed , or otherwise treated , and then napped a second time .
