List of islands by area     this is a list of islands in the world ordered by area . it includes all islands with an area greater than 250,000 kmÂ² ( 96,526 square miles ) . although an island is , in general , any land mass that is completely surrounded by water , some definitions exclude land masses large enough to be considered continents . placing australia in the latter category ( even though arguments can be made whether it is technically a continent , or merely part of the larger continent called australasia ) makes greenland the largest island . for the sake of classification the list of islands will begin with greenland .
