Zira Tehsil     zira ( ) was one of the two tehsils of the punjab , ( the other one being ferozpur ) , that was part of a controversy during the partition of india . sir cyril radcliffe created the boundary between india and pakistan just days before the partition . a draft of the award was supposedly sent to evan jenkins , the provincial governor of punjab by george abell , lord mountbatten â€™ s private secretary , with a preliminary description of the punjab boundary . this draft showed the ferozepur and zira tehsils being allotted to pakistan . the final version of the boundary however awarded the areas to india . this led muhammad ali jinnah , the founder of pakistan , to proclaim that the award of the boundary commission was unjust , incomprehensible and perverse . he , however , agreed to abide by it . the dispute was settled in 1960 as part of an agreement between the governments of india and pakistan .
