Taung Child     the taung child is a fossil of a skull . the skull also has an imprint of the brain . it belongs to an `` australopithecus africanus '' . it was discovered in 1924 by a quarryman working for the northern lime company in taung , south africa . raymond dart , an anatomist at the university of witwatersrand , looked at the fossil , and saw its importance . dart published his account in the journal `` nature '' in 1925 , describing it as a new species . british anthropologists at the time believed in the piltdown man . this hoax had a large brain and ape-like teeth – the exact opposite of the taung child – so dart 's finding was not appreciated for decades . the fossil consists of most of the skull , face and mandible with teeth . it also has a natural endocast ( imprint ) of the braincase . it is about 2.5 million years old . taung child is believed to have been about three years old at the time of its death . it was a creature standing 3 ' 6 '' ( 105 cm ) at approximately 20-24 pounds . taung child had a cranial capacity of 340 cc , living mainly in a savanna habitat . examinations of taung child compared to that of an equivalent 9-year-old child suggest that `` a. africanus '' had a growth rate to adolescence which is about the same as that found in modern apes like chimpanzees rather than that of modern `` homo sapiens '' . however , later species such as `` homo ergaster '' / '' homo erectus '' went through growth at rates between modern humans and apes . the evidence has mostly been based on that of turkana boy discovered in 1984 .
