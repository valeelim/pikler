Fuzûlî     fużūlī ( فضولی ) was the pen name of the poet muhammad bin suleyman ( محمد بن سليمان ) ( c. 1483 – 1556 ) . he is one of the greatest contributors to the dîvân tradition of turkish literature , fuzûlî wrote his collected poems ( dîvân ) in three different languages : azerbaijani turkish , persian , and arabic . although his turkish works are written in azerbaijani , he knew both the ottoman and the chagatai turkish literary traditions as well . he was also very able in mathematics and astronomy . fuzûlî was born around 1483 in what is now iraq ; he was probably born in either karbalā ’ or an-najaf . fuzûlî 's ancestors had been of nomadic origin , but his family had long since settled in towns . fuzûlî was educated by his father—who was a mufti in the city of al hillah — and then by a teacher named rahmetullah . it was during this time that he learned the persian and arabic languages in addition to his native azerbaijani . one of the few things that is known of fuzûlî 's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name . in the introduction to his collected persian poems , he says : `` in the early days when i was just beginning to write poetry , every few days i would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name '' . eventually , he decided upon the arabic word `` fuzûlî '' —which literally means `` impertinent , improper , unnecessary '' —because he `` knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else '' . despite the name 's pejorative meaning , however , it contains a double meaning—what is called `` tevriyye '' ( توريه ) in ottoman divan poetry — as fuzûlî himself explains : `` i was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary `` fuzûl '' ( ﻓﻀﻮل ) is given as a plural of `` fazl '' ( ﻓﻀﻞ ; 'learning ' ) and has the same rhythm as `` ‘ ulûm '' ( ﻋﻠﻮم ; 'sciences ' ) and `` fünûn '' ( ﻓﻨﻮن ; 'arts ' ) '' .
