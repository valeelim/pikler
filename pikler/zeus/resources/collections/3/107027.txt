Centrifugal force     in physics , centrifugal force ( from latin centrum `` center '' and fugere `` to flee '' ) is a fictitious force that appears when describing physics in a rotating reference frame ; it acts on anything with mass considered in such a frame . centrifugal force is `` fictitious '' because although it may feel to a person like a certain force is being exerted on them , someone outside the scene will see something different . example : if john is in a car that takes a sharp right turn , he will feel as though he is being pushed to his left . this is an imaginary force , called a centrifugal force , or a `` running away from the center '' force . john feels it because he is inside the car and is affected by it . however , if john 's friend , andy , is on the side of the road facing the front of john 's car and watches john 's car take a sharp right turn , andy will see the car push john to the right with the car as it changes direction . this is a real force called centripetal force ( or an `` aiming towards the center '' force ) and acts towards the center of the circle of rotation .
