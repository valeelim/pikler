Tor (software)    tor ( software ) tor ( which stands for t-o-r , the onion router ) is a server that keeps users anonymous on the internet . it works by moving data across many tor servers , called `` hops '' . the role of each server is to only move that data to another server . with the final hop moving data to the end site . as a result , information transmitted in this way is hard to trace . tor is also the name that some people give to the web browser used to access the tor server , the tor browser bundle . the browser is actually a specific version of mozilla firefox that has been changed so that it is extremely safe and secure . tor is used to hide internet users . people who run the tor network run a network of onion routers . this makes the location of the user secret . services can also be hosted from `` secret '' locations using the tor `` hidden services '' feature . a hidden service is an anonymous website that search engines like google do n't know about , and it uses an onion address as its url . onion addresses are urls that looks like 16 random letters and numbers and ends with codice_1 . people usually use the tor browser to go to those sites .
