Ecliptic     the ecliptic is the apparent path that the sun traces out in the sky during the year . as it appears to move in the sky in relation to the stars , the apparent path aligns with the planets throughout the course of the year . it is the intersection of a spherical surface , the celestial sphere , with the ecliptic plane , which is the geometric plane containing the mean orbit of the earth around the sun . the ecliptic plane should be distinguished from the invariable plane . this is the average plane of the orbits of the planets . more precisely , it is perpendicular to the vector sum of the angular momenta of all planetary orbital planes , to which jupiter is the main contributor . the present ecliptic plane is inclined to the invariable ecliptic plane by about 1.5Â° . the name ecliptic is derived from being the place where eclipses occur .
