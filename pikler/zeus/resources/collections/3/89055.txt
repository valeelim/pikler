Network-attached storage     network attached storage ( or nas ) is a solution from computing . it means that storage ( like a number of hard disks ) is put on a computer network . different users can then access this using different protocols . today , boxes that already can do this are available rather cheaply . also , such boxes can be built easily using a small or old computer with an operating system like linux . the different clients can then access the data using different protocols , like smb or nfs . nas is easier to do than a storage area network .
