Bowling     bowling is a sport where people roll a heavy ball . it was invented centuries ago when grenades were heavy iron balls . two main kinds of bowling arose . in one kind the bowler rolls a ball near a target and knocks away the ball of another bowler . this kind includes lawn bowling . in the more common kind nowadays , the bowler rolls the ball down a bowling lane trying to knock down wooden bowling pins . this kind includes ten-pin bowling , which is so commonplace that it is often simply called `` bowling '' . some people bowl at smaller pins , called `` duck pins '' or `` candle pins '' with slightly different rules . the usual kind of bowling ball has three holes , where the player puts two fingers and the thumb . the person on the lane swings the ball and lets it go to roll along the lane , attempting to knock down ten wooden pins . if the bowler does not do it right , the ball might not knock all the pins down or might roll into the gutter and hit none . players take turns rolling their ball down the lane to see who gets the highest score .
