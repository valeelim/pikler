Survival of the fittest     survival of the fittest is a famous phrase of herbert spencer which describes the idea that , in nature , there is competition to survive and reproduce . it is a metaphor , as are the phrases `` struggle for existence '' , and `` natural selection '' , both of which were used by charles darwin . scientists often use such metaphors as shorthand for key ideas . these metaphors stick in the mind , but they need to be properly understood , or they may be used wrongly . herbert spencer was a british social philosopher who applied his personal conception of evolution to many other fields , from the origin of the solar system to economics . he first used the term in his book `` principles of biology '' , published in 1864. in that book ( vol 1 p444 ) he wrote : `` this survival of the fittest , which i have here sought to express in mechanical terms , is that which mr. darwin has called ‘ natural selection ’ , or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life '' . spencer later published a book called `` the man versus the state '' . there , he used the phrase to explain why societies of a militant type would not adopt his theories . the way he uses the term suggests he is talking about a general principle .
