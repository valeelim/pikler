Metis (moon)    metis ( moon ) metis or , is jupiter 's closest moon . metis was found in 1979 by stephen p. synnott in images taken by the voyager 1 probe . its designation was . in 1983 it was named after the mythological metis , a titaness who was the first wife of zeus ( the greek equivalent of jupiter ) . metis not a sphere and measures 60×40×34 km across . the composition and mass of metis are not known , but assuming that its mean density is like that of amalthea ( ~0.86 g/cm³ ) , its mass can be estimated as ~7×10 kg . amalthea 's density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10-15 % , and adrastea may be similar . the surface of metis is very cratered . it is dark and appears to be reddish in color . metis is the closest moon to jupiter . it orbits jupiter at a distance of ~1269,000 km . it has a very small orbital eccentricity ( ~0.0002 ) and inclination ( ~ 0.06° ) relative to the equator of jupiter . the images taken by `` voyager 1 '' showed metis only as a dot , and very little was known about metis until the arrival of the `` galileo '' spacecraft . `` galileo '' took pictures of almost all of the surface of metis and put constraints on its composition .
