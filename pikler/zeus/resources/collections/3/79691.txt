Square number     a square number , sometimes also called a perfect square , is the result of an integer multiplied by itself . 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 and 25 are the first five square numbers . in a formula , the square of a number '' n '' is denoted ( exponentiation ) , usually pronounced as `` '' n '' squared '' . the name square number comes from the name of the shape ; see below . square numbers are non-negative . another way of saying that a ( non-negative ) number is a square number , is that its square root is again an integer . for example , = 3 , so 9 is a square number . the squares smaller than 60 are : there are infinitely many square numbers , as there are infinitely many natural numbers . the number '' m '' is a square number if and only if one can compose a square of `` m '' equal ( lesser ) squares : a square with side length `` n '' has area . the expression for the `` n '' th square number is `` n '' . this is also equal to the sum of the first `` n '' odd numbers as can be seen in the above pictures , where a square results from the previous one by adding an odd number of points ( shown in magenta ) . the formula follows :
