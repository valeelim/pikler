Qoppa     koppa or qoppa ( uppercase/lowercase ) was a letter of the greek alphabet that was used in some greek cities before the alphabet got its classic standard form . it is no longer used in normal writing today . it was pronounced as `` k '' , just like kappa ( κ ) . in the 5th century bc people stopped using it and only wrote kappa . in the order of the letters in the alphabet , it came between pi and rho , just like in the latin alphabet the letter q comes between p and r. however , they kept koppa as a sign for the number `` 90 '' in the system of greek numerals . people still sometimes use it in this way , even though they do not use it as a letter to write words . the letter koppa at first looked like a circle with a small bar under it . later it was written more like a pointed s. the letter q in the latin alphabet and the letter ҁ in the cyrillic alphabet come from koppa . other websites . - koppa
