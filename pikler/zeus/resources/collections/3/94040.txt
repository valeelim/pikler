Toad (Nintendo)    toad ( nintendo ) toad and the species were first seen in the game `` super mario bros. '' . toad 's design was made directly from the power up , the super mushroom as well as the game 's general use with mushrooms . shigeru miyamoto , the creator of the mario series , made a reason that toad 's creation was that of being a character that has a simplistic design ; yet , still appears cute and lovely and pleases to everybody . in the game , the peaceful toads of the mushroom kingdom had been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil king bowser ; however , some of princess toadstool 's loyal servants , known as the `` mushroom retainers '' were simply kidnapped . during the making of `` new super mario bros. wii '' , the developers at nintendo decided between four characters to be playable in the game : princess peach , toad , wario and waluigi ( all suggestions made by fans ) . two toads ( yellow and blue ) were eventually included as playable characters in `` new super mario bros. wii '' due to their physical similarity to mario and luigi .
