Lulu (opera)    lulu ( opera ) lulu is an opera by the composer alban berg . berg took the story from two plays called `` erdgeist '' and `` die büchse des pandora '' by the german playwright frank wedekind . berg wrote the libretto ( the words for the opera ) himself . many people found `` lulu '' very shocking because the story is very decadent . there is a lot of blood , murder , sex and violence in it . also : berg ’ s music was quite difficult to understand . he uses twelve tone music , which is not in any particular key , although he uses it to make a style of music which is often very romantic and expressive . berg started to write the opera in 1929 , but then he stopped working on it to write his violin concerto . when berg died , he had not finished the last act of the opera , he had only sketched it . schoenberg was asked whether he would finish the opera , but he thought it would be too much work . when the opera was first performed in 1937 there were only two acts : the opera was unfinished . berg ’ s widow , helene , said that nobody was allowed to finish it and that it should stay unfinished . for more than 40 years , that is how the opera was performed .
