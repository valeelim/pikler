Carbon fiber     carbon fiber or carbon fibre is also sometimes called graphite fiber . it has the highest compressive strength of all the reinforcing materials ( composites ) , and it has a high strength to weight ratio and low coefficient of thermal expansion . the density of carbon fiber is also much lower than the density of steel . carbon fiber is in the form of several thousand long , thin strands of material that is composed of mostly carbon atoms . carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly carbon fiber reinforced polymers . reinforced carbon-carbon ( rcc ) is used structurally in high-temperature applications . the fiber is also used to filter high-temperature gases . molding a thin layer of carbon fibers significantly improves fire resistance of polymers or thermoset composites . this works because a dense , compact layer of carbon fibers efficiently reflects heat . the increasing use of carbon fiber composites is displacing aluminum from aerospace applications in favor of other metals .
