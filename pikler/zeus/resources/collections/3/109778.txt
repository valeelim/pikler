Poplar Forest     the poplar forest is the retreat home of thomas jefferson , third president of the united states of america near lynchburg , virginia . his wife inherited the 4,819 acre plantation and he built an octagonal retreat home there which was basically complete in the year 1812. the home contains a central dining room in the shape of a cube , measuring 20 feet on all sides and lit from a skylight above . currently under restoration , the building gives a fascinating glimpse of how things were built in those days , as well as showing off a few of jefferson 's inventions such as the triple sash window . jefferson used the property as a respite from the busy monticello , which was always welcoming visitors , and spent most of his time there only with close family members . he had a library containing 700 volumes and he used his time there to communicate with his 'absent friends ' , in other words , to catch up on his written correspondence .
