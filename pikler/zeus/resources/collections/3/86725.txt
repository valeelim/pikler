Jenkem     jenkem is an alleged drug that was supposedly invented in poor parts of africa . when it is ready to be used , it is a gas . it is created from feces left in a container to ferment for a long time . when breathed in , jenkem makes the person see crazy things . it is like a crazy dream , the person imagines things happening that are not really happening . the person may also hear sounds that are not really there . this is called a hallucination . jenkem is also used to make a person happy . because it is made out of fermented waste ( or old feces ) , it is also very stinky . some say it is as if you have a curtain in front of you . because jenkem is human waste and is inhaled ( huffing ) , the person can get an infection because of the dirt and germs in the waste . jenkem also contains methane , which is explosive and flammable .
