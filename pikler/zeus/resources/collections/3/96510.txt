Non-Euclidean geometry     non-euclidean geometry is a type of geometry . non-euclidean geometry only uses some of the `` postulates '' ( assumptions ) that euclidean geometry is based on . in normal geometry , parallel lines can never meet . in non-euclidean geometry they can meet , either once ( elliptic geometry ) , or infinitely many ( hyperbolic geometry ) times . an example of non-euclidian geometry can be seen by drawing lines on a ball or other round object , straight lines that are parallel at the equator can meet at the poles it is called `` non-euclidean '' because it is different from euclidean geometry , which was discovered by an ancient greek mathematician called euclid . the different names for non-euclidean geometries come from thinking of `` straight '' lines as curved lines , either curved inwards like an ellipse , or outwards like a hyperbola . the first authors of non-euclidean geometries were the hungarian mathematician j√°nos bolyai and the russian mathematician nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky , who separately published treatises on hyperbolic geometry around 1830. others , such as carl friedrich gauss , had earlier ideas , but did not publish their ideas at the time .
