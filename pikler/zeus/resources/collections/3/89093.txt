C-type asteroid     c-type asteroids are asteroids made of carbonates . they are the most common variety taking up around 75 % of known asteroids , and an even higher percentage in the farther part of the belt beyond 2.7 au , which is dominated by this asteroid type . the amount of c-types may actually be higher than this , because c-types are much darker than most other asteroid types except d-types and others common only at the extreme farther edge of the main belt . this type of asteroid has very similar spectra to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites ( types ci and cm ) , whose chemical make-up is about the same as the sun and the primitive solar nebula , except that they do not contain hydrogen , helium and other volatiles . hydrated ( water-containing ) minerals are present . c-type asteroids are very dark with albedos usually in the 0.03 to 0.10 range . consequently , whereas a number of s-types can normally be viewed with binoculars at opposition , even the biggest c-types require a small telescope . the potentially brightest c-type asteroid is 324 bamberga , but that object 's very high eccentricity means it rarely reaches its maximum magnitude .
