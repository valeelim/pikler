YHWH     for jewish people yhvh is the most holy name of god , as written in the ancient hebrew language . the written language showed no vowels , so the pronunciation is not agreed on . however , most academics agree that `` yahweh '' is the most accepted way to say it . it has also been pronounced as `` yehova '' in hebrew as a substitute word for the tetragramaton . this is because hebrew pointing , or vowel symbols , are often put under the yhvh , making . the vowels used come from the hebrew word for lord , `` adonai '' , which after the last captivity , was substituted and the vowels of `` adonai '' forced into the tetragrammaton , incorrectly spelling god 's hebrew name as `` yahovah '' . it was never meant to be anything more than a substitute to avoid pronouncing the tetragrammaton . traditionally , religious jews today do not often say this name aloud . this is because it is believed to be too holy to be spoken . however , they often use substitutes when referring to the name of their god . for example , they use hashem ( `` the name '' ) or shem hameforash ( “ the indescribable name ” ) .
