Decibel     a decibel ( or db ) measures ratios of power or intensity . it expresses them as an exponential function . one bel is a power ratio of 10:1 , and is divided into ten decibels . an increase of three decibels is approximately a doubling of power . decibels are often used in measuring telecommunication signals . with electric audio signals , there are several decibel units , relative to several bases . for example , dbm is relative to one milliwatt . it 's been said that the smallest difference humans can hear is 1 db and is related to the absolute threshold of hearing , although this is very subjective at best . the bel unit was named after alexander graham bell . this unit was so rough that it is more typical to use the decibel , which is one bel divided by ten . before bels , there was the transmission unit ( tu ) . often , decibels are used to say how loud a sound is relative to the threshold of hearing . the decibel is not an si unit . the table here uses db as units of sound to indicate consensus on hearing protection . some examples of sounds are :
