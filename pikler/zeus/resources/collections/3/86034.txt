Touchpad     a touchpad ( also trackpad ) is an area that imitates ( does the same ) functions of a computer mouse . there is no need of an external device like a mouse . the user just runs over the small sensitive pad with one or more fingers . touchpads are mostly found on laptop computers . they are also more and more used on devices like mp3 players ( apple ipod ) and mobile phones as well . it is good to have the touchpad , because when the user is travelling , sometimes he or she can not use a mouse . when the laptop is used at home , the user is able to attach ( connect ) a separate mouse . new models of touchpads often have more functions because they are pressure-sensitive . many have the function to scroll up and down a page or the volume field . most touchpads have the function of tapping , which imitates the left-click button on a mouse . the user can choose and change , which functions happen , if the user does certain moves . example : the normal function for tapping on the pad is the left-click on the mouse . the user can change it in the settings section to the right-click of the mouse , if the user likes it better .
