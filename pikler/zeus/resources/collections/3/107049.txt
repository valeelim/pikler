Western Front (World War I)    western front ( world war i ) at the beginning of world war i in 1914 , the german army started the western front by invading luxembourg and belgium . they gained military control of many important industrial regions in france . their quick advance was stopped by the battle of the marne . both sides then dug defensive trenches . the trenches eventually reached from the north sea to the swiss border with france . during the years between 1915 and 1917 , many offensives were started from these trenches . bothe sides used large numbers of artillery and thousands of infantry in these offensives . however , a combination of entrenchments , machine gun nests , barbed wire , and artillery stopped these advances . no major breakthroughs happened . new military technology , like poison gas , aircraft , and tanks were developed to try and get through these lines of trenches . the deadlock is mostly due to both sides not allowing a single piece of land to give some kind of advantage to the enemy , even if there was little advantage . as the war continued and more blood was lost on both sides , the soldiers grew more and more tired of war and had begun to make large promises to the government . to keep the war effort going , they begun to say that they would kill soldiers who did not attack , saying that they were betraying the army if they did not fight .
