Brine shrimp     brine shrimp are small shrimp that live in salt water . brine shrimp are artemia , a genus of aquatic crustacea which has changed little ( externally ) since the triassic period . they can often be found in saltwater ponds and marshes , and can not live very long in fresh water . `` artemia '' avoid most types of predators , such as fish , because they live in waters of very high salinity : up to 25 % ( 250 parts per thousand ) . the optimum for `` artemia '' is 100 to 150 parts per thousand . the shrimp grow to be about one centimeter long . females tend to be larger than males . brine shrimp circulatory and respiratory systems work together to remove extra salt from their body and distribute oxygen . they breathe through gills on their feet . the oxygen taken in is carried through the bloodstream . the heart pumps the blood around the body . brine shrimp have a protein called hemoglobin in their blood . this helps the oxygen to be more efficiently transported to cells around the body . they need hemoglobin because oxygen levels can be very low in salty water . then , the gills pump the excess salt , water , and carbon dioxide out of the body . additional salt is pumped out through exocrine glands .
