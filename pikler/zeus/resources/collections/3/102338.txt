Death zone     the death zone is the name used by mountain climbers for high altitude where there is not enough oxygen for humans to breathe . this is usually above 8,000 metres ( 26,247 feet ) . most of the 200+ climbers who have died on mount everest have died in the death zone . due to the inverse relationship of air pressure to altitude , at the top of mount everest the average person takes in about 30 % of the oxygen in the air that they would take in at sea level ; a human used to breathing air at sea level could only be there for a few minutes before they became unconscious . most climbers have to carry oxygen bottles to be able to reach the top . visitors become weak and have inability to think straight and struggle making decisions , especially under stress . climber lincoln hall , who was left for dead on everest in 2006 , managed to survive . lack of oxygen in his blood made it easier for him to get frostbite . he also had headaches , nausea , vomiting and hallucinations . he thinks he had cerebral oedema â€“ or swelling of the brain . this is caused at high altitude when blood leaks into the brain itself . the swelling would have caused headaches , confusion and disorientation ( not knowing where you are ) . this could kill a person if their brain became too compressed . hall was left for dead when his breathing and heartbeat stopped . he was found the next day wandering near a cliff without his gloves or oxygen , and his climbing suit unzipped .
