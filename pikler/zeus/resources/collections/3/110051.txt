Deinonychosauria     the deinonychosauria ( `` fearsome claw lizards '' ) is a clade of bird-like theropods in the upper jurassic and cretaceous . the largest known of these was `` utahraptor '' , and `` anchiornis '' was the smallest . the group includes two rather different families . each of these is described more fully on its own page . the dromaeosauridae includes some of the most fearsome killers of the cretaceous period : `` deinonychus '' , `` velociraptor '' , and `` utahraptor '' . these are the raptors of the film `` jurassic park '' . troodontids date from the upper cretaceous and were lighter and slimmer than the dromaeosaurids . `` troodon '' and `` saurornithoides '' are two examples . as a group , they are closely related to birds . troodontids had unusually large brains , comparable to living flightless birds . their eyes were also large , and pointed forward , so they had good binocular vision . a few troodont fossils , including specimens of `` mei '' and `` sinornithoides '' , show that these animals roosted like birds , with their heads tucked under their forelimbs . they were fully feathered .
