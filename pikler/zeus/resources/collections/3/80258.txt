Ijiraq (moon)    ijiraq ( moon ) ijiraq is a non-spherical moon of saturn . it was found by the team of brett gladman , john j. kavelaars , `` et al . '' in 2000 , and given the designation . ijiraq orbits saturn at an average distance of 11,100,000 km in 451 days on an orbit very similar to kiviuq 's . the diagram illustrates its orbit in relation to other non-spherical moons of saturn . the eccentricity of the orbits is represented by the yellow segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre . while ijiraq is a member of the inuit group non-spherical moons , recent observations revealed that ijiraq is redder than paaliaq , siarnaq and kiviuq . kavelaars , an astronomer at mcmaster university , suggested this name to help astronomical nomenclature to get out of its greco-romano-renaissance rut . he spent several months trying to find names that were both multi-cultural and canadian , consulting amerindian scholars without finding a name that seemed good . in march 2001 , he was reading an inuit story to his children and had a revelation . the ijiraq plays at hide-and-seek , which is what these small moons of saturn do : they are hard to find , and cold like the canadian arctic ( the team of discoverers includes canadians , norwegians and icelandersâ€”nordicity is their common trait ) . kavelaars contacted the author of the tale , michael kusugak , to get his assent , and the latter also suggested the names for kiviuq and 90377 sedna .
