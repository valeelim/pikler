Coefficient     in mathematics , a coefficient is a constant multiplicative factor of a certain object . for example , the coefficient in `` 9x '' is `` 9 '' . the object can be such things as a variable , a vector , a function , etc . in some cases , the objects and the coefficients are indexed in the same way , leading to expressions such as : where `` a '' is the coefficient of the variable `` x '' for each `` n '' = 1 , 2 , 3 , â€¦
