Diamir District     the diamir district is a first-order administrative division of the pakistani-controlled territory known as the northern areas and is the district in which the karakoram highway enters that territory from pakistan 's khyber pakhtunkhwa . the capital of the diamir district is chilas . in 2004 , the diamir district was reduced in size as a result of the creation of the new astore district from diamir 's easternmost tehsil . ( see map . ) the diamir district is bounded by the astore district in the east , pakistan 's khyber pakhtunkhwa in the southwest ( separated by the babusar pass or babusar top ) , neelum district of azad kashmir in the south , the ghizar district in the north and northwest , and the gilgit district in the north and northeast . before the karakoram highway was opened in 1978 , the only road reaching gilgit town from the south was a rough track north from balakot to babusar pass ( via kaghan , naran , besal , and gittidas ) and farther north through babusar gah to chilas . the road up to besal is now in better condition , but from besal to babusar pass , the road is still a rough track .
