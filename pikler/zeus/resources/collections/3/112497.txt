Mysticeti     the mysticeti are one of the two suborders of the cetacea . they are often called baleen whales , or 'whalebone whales ' or 'great whales ' . baleen whales have baleen plates made of keratin . the difference is connected with feeding . baleen whales strain plankton out of the water , whereas the odontoceti ( toothed whales ) eat larger prey . the suborder contains four families and fourteen species . baleen whales do not have teeth , except as embryos . fossil adult baleen whales did have teeth , but modern adults have only baleen . the embryo teeth are replaced by baleen , which look like a curtain of long plates hanging down from the top of the whale 's mouth . those plates might be 12 feet long , and a foot or more wide . looking at them from the outside , they look like straight knives hanging down , but from the inside , they are like a big toothbrush or comb . baleen is made of keratin , a tissue also found in mammalian hair and nails . a baleen whale uses its baleen to eat . in order to feed , a baleen whale opens its mouth widely and scoops in dense shoals of plankton and other small prey ( such as krill , copepods , small fish and sometimes birds that happen to be near the shoals ) , together with a large volume of water .
