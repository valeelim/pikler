Atomic nucleus     the nucleus is the center of an atom . it is made up of nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) and is surrounded by the electron cloud . the size ( diameter ) of the nucleus is between 1.6 fm ( 10 m ) ( for a proton in light hydrogen ) to about 15 fm ( for the heaviest atoms , such as uranium ) . these sizes are much smaller than the size of the atom itself by a factor of about 23,000 ( uranium ) to about 145,000 ( hydrogen ) . the nucleus has most of the mass of an atom , though it is only a very small part of it . almost all of the mass in an atom is made up from the protons and neutrons in the nucleus with a very small contribution from the orbiting electrons . neutrons have no charge and protons are positively charged . because the nucleus is only made up of protons and neutrons it is positively charged . things that have the same charge repel each other : this repulsion is part of what is called electromagnetic force . unless there was something else holding the nucleus together it could not exist because the protons would push away from each other . the nucleus is actually held together by another force , the strong nuclear force .
