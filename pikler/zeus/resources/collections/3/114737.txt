Frugivore     a frugivore is an animal that prefers to eat fruit . the fruit is part of a plant 's sexual reproduction cycle . plants spend a lot of energy and nutrients in creating fruit . fruit is produced to attract animals into eating the fruit . the animal digests the pulp but not the seeds , ensuring the plant 's genes are spread wherever the animal goes . seeds can also be germinated by falling near the mother plant . some seeds must pass through the digestive system ( the stomach and intestines ) before they can germinate . frugivores have also evolved in different ways to eat different fruit ; some use teeth , others long beaks or short beaks . many birds eat both fruits and insects which makes them omnivores . mammals may eat both fruits and protein , or eat mostly fruit or nectar , such as many bats . one primate group is essentially herbivore/frugivore , the owl monkeys . they live in a non-seasonal area of the amazon that supports a constant supply of fruiting trees . elsewhere , an exclusively frugivore diet is impossible and is supplemented by insects or rougher plant matter . some people say that humans are frugivores ; this is unlikely given the evolution of man in the dry tropical region of the rift valley . however , the climate in the rift valley at the time of our evolution was likely a tropical rainforest . that said , almost all primates and even carnivores will travel great distances to feast when a fruit tree has dropped its ripened fruit . many species will remember the exact fruiting date and location of a fruiting tree which highlights fruits great nutritional benefit . some people promote a frugivore diet for humans .
