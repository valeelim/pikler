Californosaurus     californosaurus was an ichthyosaur , an extinct marine reptile . it was 10 feet ( 3 m ) long . it had four paddle-shaped flippers and sharp teeth in long , pointed jaws ( looking a bit like a dolphin ) . `` californosaurus '' lived during the late triassic period in seas that covered what is now california . it fed on fish and other small marine creatures . like other ichthyosaurs it probably never came onto dry land , and gave birth in the water . it is the most basal known true ichthyosaur , shaped more or less like a dolphin . the long-snouted head is small in comparison with the rest of the body , as in basal ichthyosaurs such as `` mixosaurus '' and `` cymbospondylus '' . the tail is sharply turned downwards , in common with more advanced ichthyosaurs , with a small vertical fluke . it may have had a small dorsal fin .
