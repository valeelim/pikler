Coefficient of thermal expansion     solids mostly expand in response to heating and contract on cooling . this response to temperature change is expressed as its coefficient of thermal expansion . the coefficient of thermal expansion is used : - in linear thermal expansion - in area thermal expansion - in volumetric thermal expansion these characteristics are closely related . the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be measured for all substances of condensed matter ( liquids and solid state ) . the linear thermal expansion can only be measured in the solid state and is common in engineering applications . the expansion and contraction of material must be considered when designing large structures , when using tape or chain to measure distances for land surveys , when designing molds for casting hot material , and in other engineering applications when large changes in dimension due to temperature are expected . the range for α is from 10 for hard solids to 10 for organic liquids . α varies with the temperature and some materials have a very high variation . some values for common materials , given in parts per million per celsius degree : ( note : this can also be in kelvins as the changes in temperature are a 1:1 ratio )
