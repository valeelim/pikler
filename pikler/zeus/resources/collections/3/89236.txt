Ghoul     a ghoul is a monster from ancient arabian folklore . ghouls live in burial grounds and other uninhabited places . the english word comes from the arabic name for the creature : الغول `` ghūl '' , which literally means `` demon '' . the `` ghul '' is a devilish type of jinn believed to be sired by iblis . the female form is given as `` ghouleh '' in muhawi and kanaana ( see ref below ) . the plural is `` ghilan '' . `` ghoul '' is also a shapeshifting demon that lives in the desert . the demon can take the form of an animal , especially a hyena . it lures unwary travellers into the desert . it will then kill and eat them . the creature also preys on young children , robs graves , and eats the dead . because of this habit , the word `` ghoul '' is sometimes used to refer to an ordinary human such as a grave robber , or to anyone who likes the macabre . the star algol takes its name from this creature . in iranian mythologies , ghouls are creatures very similar to humans , but larger . usually they are less intelligent and not necessarily evil .
