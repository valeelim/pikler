Sunspot     a sunspot is an area of high magnetic activity , on the surface of the sun . sunspots produce bright light , but not as much as the surface around them , so they appear dark by comparison . they are cooler than the rest of the sun . some are small , and some are ten times bigger than earth . a sunspot cycle of eleven years has been found , with changes in activity . every 11 years the number of sunspots increases , and later declines . sunspots on one cycle are magnetically different from the next , so the total sunspot cycle is 22 years . this cycle has been seen since the 18th century . before that time , for over a hundred years , there were very few sunspots . astronomers do not know what caused this `` maunder minimum '' . chinese astronomers said they could see sunspots . on 17 march 802 the monk adelmus saw a big sunspot , which he could see for eight days . adelmus thought that mercury was going in front of the sun and making a black spot . however , they did not really know what sunspots were until galileo galilei in 1612 .
