Dynamic random-access memory     dynamic random access memory is the most used form of ram . dram is called dynamic ( or active ) , because it must be refreshed all the time or it will lose the data which it is supposed to be storing . that is why it is called “ volatile ” . if something is volatile , it runs away quickly . refreshing dram means `` reading '' the data `` from '' the dram and directly `` writing '' them `` back '' to the dram . dram is made up of millions of very small capacitors . each of these capacitors has a transistor to let energy in and out . the capacitor slowly loses energy , and if the dram is not refreshed , in the end one or more of the capacitors will let so much energy out , that for example a 1 will become a 0 , so data will be lost or corrupted . almost all computers refresh their dram many times per second . dram is often compared to sram ( static ram ) . sram is able to store data as long as power/energy is used . there is no need to refresh it . sram can also be faster than dram . but sram is much more expensive than dram . also , sram uses more electric power and heats up much faster than dram .
