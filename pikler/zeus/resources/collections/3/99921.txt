S/2004 S 6     it was first seen by scientists in pictures taken by the cassini-huygens probe on october 28 , 2004 , and announced on 8 november that year . it appears to be the best tracked object in this area with at least five possible sightings in the period till late 2005. in comparison , two objects in the f ring 's area ( and ) that were first seen months earlier have not been found again with any confidence . nevertheless , it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to or whether it is just a dust clump that will disappear in years or months . notably , an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 november , 2004 ( soon after 's discovery ) failed to find the object , while it has been seen again later . the lighting conditions in 's part of the orbit were different during these two sightings , however , with the discovery being made when the area was strongly backlit by the sun . a suggested resolution of the absence in november is that 's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light ( the conditions of the discovery image ) , and that the solid core ( if any ) is small .
