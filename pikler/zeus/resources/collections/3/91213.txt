Pianola     the pianola ( pronounce : `` pee-ah-no-la '' ) , also called the player piano , is a piano which has a pneumatic mechanism so that it can play by itself . the air for this system came from a pump operated by the players feet , and in some later models , an electric pump . inside the piano are paper rolls which have holes punched in . these holes release air which in turn triggers the keys to play . when the pianola plays itself the keys of the piano can be seen `` playing themselves '' . the pianola was developed around the 1880s . it was fitted with control levers so that the player ( `` player pianist '' or `` pianolist '' ) could play in the way he wanted . the pianola made it possible for the player to sound as if he was playing very difficult music that he was not capable of playing . at the same time he could control the performance . the pianola became popular in the late 19th and early 20th century as mass-produced pianos became popular in people 's homes and more and more people bought sheet music . by the 1920s it started to become less popular again as the gramophone had been invented .
