Night of the Long Knives     the night of the long knives ( german : ) or `` operation hummingbird '' ( ) , was a purge that took place in nazi germany between 30 june and 2 july 1934 , when the nazi regime executed at least 90 people for political reasons . most of those killed were members of the `` storm troopers '' ( sa ) ( german : ) . adolf hitler moved against the sa and its leader , ernst röhm , because he saw the independence of the sa and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his power . hitler also wanted to forestall any move by leaders of the reichswehr , the german military , who both feared and despised the sa , to curtail his rule , especially since röhm made no secret of his ambition to absorb the reichswehr with himself at its head . finally , hitler used the purge to go against conservative critics of his regime , especially those loyal to vice-chancellor franz von papen , and to settle scores with old enemies , such as kurt von schleicher . other websites . - the night of long knives
