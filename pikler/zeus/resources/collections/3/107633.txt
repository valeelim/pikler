Hallstatt     hallstatt is a village in upper austria . currently , a little over 900 people live there . it is in the salzkammergut , a mountain regionin austria . it lies on a lake . because of its position , hallstatt could only be reached by boat ( or by using narrow , difficult mountain trails ) for a long time . at the end of the 19th century a road was built . despite this , even in the neolithic people might have lived there . this is because there is a lot of natural salt there . in 1846 , johann georg ramsauer ( a salt miner ) found a cemetery from the neolithic age just above the village . a cultural epoch in europe is named after this . it is called hallstatt culture . other finds in the region include a shoe-last celt ( a special kind of wedge , probably used to treat wood ) . a blacksmith site has also been excavatzed . today , the village lives mainly on tourism . there is a copy of the village in china .
