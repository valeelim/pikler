Hermeticism     hermeticism is the study and practice of occult philosophy and magic . the name comes from the fact that the first books about hermeticism are said to have been written by the god hermes trismegistus ( `` thrice-greatest hermes '' ) , who combines aspects of the greek god hermes and the egyptian god thoth . hermeticism is also connected with astrology and alchemy . these beliefs were strong in europe during the renaissance . the hermetic corpus was translated by marsilio ficino in 1463 and published in 1471. at this time , the hermetic corpus was thought to be older than both plato and pythagoras . in 1614 , isaac causabon showed that the texts were actually written sometime between 200 and 300 ad . this view was based on careful study of the way language was used in the original writings . hermeticism was revived in the 19th century in western europe . the most famous group involved in this revival was the hermetic order of the golden dawn .
