Entertainment Software Rating Board     the entertainment software rating board ( esrb ) is an organization that rates video games . rating is voluntary . game publishers do not have to submit their games for ratings . there are seven ratings : e ( everyone ) , e10+ ( everyone 10+ ) , t ( teen ) , m ( mature 17+ ) , ao ( adults only ) , and rp ( rating pending ) . some retailers make people show identification to prove their age if they want to buy m-rated games . many retailers will not buy and sell ao games so it is very hard for gamers to find ao-rated games . on the back of each game 's box , the esrb also rates elements of the game . the back of `` super princess peach '' has the words `` comic mischief '' on it to tell parents that it contains comic mischief . some critics come to believe that the esrb only rates games ao if they have sex in them , regardless of how explicit the language , violence or even blood is . this also lead them to think the esrb is not doing its job . twenty-three games have received and kept adult ratings , but apparently twenty ( almost all ) games were given it for sexual themes and content . two had violence , and the other one was given the `` adult '' rating for real gambling .
