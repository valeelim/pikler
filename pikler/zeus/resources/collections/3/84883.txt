Volcanic eruption     a volcanic eruption occurs when hot materials are thrown out of a volcano . lava , rocks , dust , and gas compounds are some of these `` ejecta '' . eruptions can come from side branches or from the top of the volcano . some eruptions are terrible explosions that throw out huge amounts of rock and ash and kill many people . some are quiet outflows of hot lava . several more complex types of volcanic eruptions have been described by volcanologists . these are often named after famous volcanoes where that type of eruption has been seen . some volcanoes may show only one type of eruption during a period of activity , while others may show a range of types in a series . the volcanic explosivity index ( commonly shortened vei ) is a scale , from 0 to 8 , for measuring the strength of eruptions . it is used by the smithsonian institution 's global volcanism program in assessing the impact of historic and prehistoric lava flows . it operates in a way similar to the richter scale for earthquakes , in that each interval in value represents a tenfold increasing in magnitude ( it is logarithmic ) . most volcanic eruptions are of veis between 0 and 2 .
