Cryptanalysis     cryptanalysis ( from the greek `` kryptós '' , `` hidden '' , and `` analýein '' , `` to loosen '' or `` to untie '' ) is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information , without access to the secret information which is normally required to do so . typically , this involves finding a secret key . in non-technical language , this is the practice of codebreaking or cracking the code , although `` break '' can also mean just a part of a complete solution . people have been making and breaking codes for many centuries . in the 1930s specialized machines were invented to do the calculations . code-breaking machines such as the colossus computer were important during world war ii . computers were the main tool of cryptanalysis in the cold war and later . related pages . - code - cryptography references . - helen fouché gaines , `` cryptanalysis '' , 1939 , dover . isbn 0-486-20097-3 other websites . - basic cryptanalysis - simon singh 's crypto corner - distributed computing projects - ultraanvil tool for attacking simple substitution ciphers
