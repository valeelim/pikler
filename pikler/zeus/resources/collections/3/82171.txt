9 Metis     9 metis is one of the biggest main belt asteroids . it is made of silicates and metallic nickel-iron , and may be the core remnant of a big asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient collision . metis was found by andrew graham on april 25 , 1848 ; it was his only asteroid discovery . it is also the only asteroid to have been found as a result of observations from ireland . its name comes from the mythological metis , a titaness and oceanid , daughter of tethys and oceanus . the name `` thetis '' was also considered and rejected ( it would later devolve to 17 thetis ) . metis ' direction of rotation is unknown at present . hubble space telescope images and lightcurve analyses are in agreement that metis has a non-spherical stretched shape with one pointed and one broad end . radar observations suggest the presence of a significant flat area , in agreement with the shape model from lightcurves . what the surface is made of has been estimated as 30-40 % metal-bearing olivine and 60-70 % ni-fe metal . light curve data on metis led to an assumption that it could have a moon . however , subsequent observations failed to confirm this . later searches with the hubble space telescope in 1993 found no moons .
