Château     a ( plural `` '' ) is a manor house or residence of the lord of the manor or a country house of nobility or gentry . it may have fortifications , but often has none . the term comes from french-speaking regions and is used most often for buildings in these regions . where clarification is needed , a fortified château ( that is , a castle ) is called a `` château fort '' . but the word is not used in the same way as `` castle '' is in english , and most châteaux are more appropriately described as `` palaces '' or `` country houses '' in english than as `` castles '' . for example , the château de versailles is so called because it was in the country when it was built , but it does not bear any resemblance to a castle , so it is usually known in english as the palace of versailles . other websites . - photos of loire châteaux - château de l'isle-marie - roquetaillade castle - château de ravignan - château de montreuil-bellay - château de fontainebleau - château de bellocq bearn ( in french ) - château saint-aubin - château of gaston phoebus at morlanne in bearn
