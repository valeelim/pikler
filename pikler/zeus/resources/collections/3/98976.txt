Trench warfare     trench warfare is a war tactic , or way of fighting . it was commonly used on the western front in the first world war but also at other wars and other places . in trench warfare , the two sides fighting each other dug trenches in a battlefield . these trenches had many different parts , such as places for sleeping , for headquarters , for storage , and for artillery and machine guns . between the front trenches on a battlefield , was an area called `` no man 's land '' . this area was often covered with barbed wire and land mines . soldiers on either side would try to cross the no man 's land to get to the enemy 's trench and attack . tanks were commonly used to cross this land . trench warfare was used because it gave soldiers cover while defending themselves against attack . it also gave soldiers bunks to sleep in , although the bunks were very unclean and uncomfortable . world war i started in 1914 and ended in 1918. while fighting , soldiers needed self-defense . so , they dug holes . the holes were two meters deep . these holes were called trenches . most soldiers fought in the trenches . the trenches were not very far apart . for example , they could have been as short as thirty meters in between each trench . this open space was called dead man â€™ s land . death was frequent , even when there was no fighting ( for example , by diseases ) . this was called trench warfare .
