Saharan Air Layer     the saharan air layer ( sal ) is an intensely dry , warm and sometimes dust-laden layer of the atmosphere which often overlays the cooler , more-humid surface air of the atlantic ocean . in the sahara desert region of north africa , where it originates , it is the prevalent atmosphere , extending from the surface upwards several kilometers . as it drives , or is driven , out over the ocean , it is lifted above the denser marine air . this arrangement is an inversion where the temperature increases with height . the boundary between the sal and the marine layer suppresses or `` caps '' any convection originating in the marine layer . since it is dry air , the lapse rate within the sal itself is steep , that is , the temperature falls rapidly with height . other websites . - noaa faq : saharan air layer - real time sal data - ha ! look at 2006 ! where are the hurricanes ? - research : aerosols slow wind
