Dynamic pressure     in fluid dynamics dynamic pressure depends on density and velocity of the fluid . it is defined by the following equation ( with q standing for `` dynamic pressure '' or `` velocity pressure '' ) : where ( using si units ) : dynamic pressure is closely related to the kinetic energy of a fluid particle , since both quantities are proportional to the particle 's mass ( through the density , in the case of dynamic pressure ) and square of the velocity . dynamic pressure is in fact one of the terms of bernoulli 's equation , which is essentially an equation of energy conservation for a fluid in motion . other pages . - pressure other websites . - definition of dynamic pressure on `` eric weisstein 's world of science ''
