Deductive reasoning     deduction is one of the two main types of reasoning . the other is induction . in deduction , we apply a general rule to a particular case . deductive arguments are attempts to show that a conclusion must follow from a set of premises or hypotheses . a deductive argument is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises . aristotle , the first person we know who wrote down laws of deduction , gives this example of deduction : - all men are mortal . - socrates is a man . - therefore , socrates is a mortal . the first two statements are called `` premises '' . the last statement is called the `` conclusion '' . the conclusion is taken from the premises . 1. if the conclusion is wrong , then at least one of the premises is wrong 1. if one of the premises is wrong , the conclusion may also be wrong . deductive reasoning is often called `` top-down logic '' , whereas inductive reasoning is called `` bottom-up reasoning '' .
