Sperm whale     ï¿¼ the sperm whale ( `` physeter catodon '' ) is the largest toothed whale . it has the biggest head of any animal . the head can be about long , and is about one-third of the whale 's body . its lower jaw is small and contains its huge , conical teeth ( which fit into sockets in the upper jaw ) . sperm whales are carnivores ( meat-eaters ) . they mostly hunt medium-sized squid . they also eat many kinds of fish such as skate . sometimes they hunt giant squid that live on the ocean bottom at great depths . they can dive up to 2250 m and stay underwater for 1 hour . the largest bulls ( males ) will sometimes even eat colossal squid . sperm whales can reach up to 20.5m long , and weigh up to 57,000kg . like other toothed whales , the sperm whale uses echolocation , a way of sensing in which they emit high-pitched clicks and sense them as they bounce back off objects ( like prey ) . this is crucial in hunting in the dark ocean depths .
