Flora family     the flora family of asteroids is a big group of s-type asteroids in the closer part of the main belt , whose origin and properties are not well understood right now . about 4-5 % of all main belt asteroids belong to this family . because of its poorly defined edges , and the location of flora itself near the edge , this asteroid group has also sometimes been called the ariadne family , when flora did not make it into the group during an analysis ( e.g . the wam analysis by zappala 1995 ) . the biggest member is 8 flora , which mesures 140 km in diameter , and takes up about 80 % of the total family mass . nevertheless , the parent body was almost for sure destroyed by the impact/s that made the family , and flora is probably a gravitational aggregate of most of the pieces . 43 ariadne makes up much of the remaining mass ( about a further 9 % , with the remaining family members being fairly small , below 30 km in diameter . because of the high background density of asteroids in this part of space , one might expect that a great number of asteroids unrelated to the collision that made the family would be present . however , few have been found . this is because unrelated asteroids are hard to distinguish from family members because the family is of the same spectral type ( s ) that dominates the closer main belt overall . the few unrelated asteroids that have been found are all small ( florczak `` et al . '' 1998 , and also by inspection of the pds asteroid taxonomy data set for non s-type members . ) they include 298 baptistina , 422 berolina , 2093 genichesk , 2259 sofievka ( the biggest , with a 21 km diameter ) , 2952 liliputia , 3533 toyota , 3850 peltier , 3875 staehle , 4278 harvey , 4396 gressmann , and 4750 mukai .
