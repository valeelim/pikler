Theory of Colours     theory of colours ( original german title , zur farbenlehre ) is a book by johann wolfgang von goethe published in 1810. it contains some of the earliest and most accurate descriptions of phenomena such as coloured shadows , refraction , and chromatic aberration . its influence extends primarily to the art world , especially among the pre-raphaelites . turner studied it comprehensively , and referred to it in the titles of several paintings . wassily kandinsky considered goethe 's theory `` one of the most important works '' . although goethe 's work was never well received by physicists , a number of philosophers and physicists have been known to have concerned themselves with it , including arthur schopenhauer , kurt g√∂del , werner heisenberg , ludwig wittgenstein , and hermann von helmholtz . mitchell feigenbaum even convinced himself that `` goethe had been right about colour ! '' in his book , goethe shows how colour is perceived in a variety of circumstances , and considers isaac newton 's observations to be special cases . goethe 's concern was not so much with the measurement of colour phenomenon , but with how qualities of colour are perceived . science has come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum , as observed by newton , and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by goethe .
