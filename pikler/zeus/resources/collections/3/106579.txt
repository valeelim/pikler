Theodor Schwann     theodor schwann ( 7 december 1810 – 11 january 1882 ) was a german scientist who isolated and named the enzyme pepsin . he also played a key role in promoting the idea of the cell as the foundation of living organisms . his work on the cell has recently been re-assessed , because the idea had been discussed before him . cells were discovered by robert hooke ( 1635–1703 ) . he used a compound microscope with two lenses to look at the structure of cork , and to look at leaves and some insects . he did this from about 1660 , and reported it in his book `` micrographica '' in 1665. many other naturalists and philosophers tried out the new instrument . the structure of plants was investigated by nehemiah grew ( 1641–1712 ) and marcello malpighi ( 1628–1694 ) . grew 's major work was `` the anatomy of plants '' ( 1682 ) . it is not clear who first saw animal cells , malpighi , jan swammerdam ( 1637–1680 ) or antonie van leeuwenhoek ( 1632–1723 ) . leeuwenhoek 's discoveries and drawings of 'little animalcules ' opened up a whole new world for naturalists . protozoa , and microorganisms generally were discovered . christian gottfried ehrenberg 's book `` die infusionsthierchen '' summarised what was known in 1838. lorenz oken ( 1779–1851 ) in 1805 wrote that infusoria ( microscopic forms ) were the basis of all life .
