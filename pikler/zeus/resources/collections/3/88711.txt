532 Herculina     532 herculina `` ( herr'-kew-lye'-n…ô , '' ) is a very big asteroid , with a diameter of around 225 km . it was found on april 20th , 1904 , by max wolf in heidelberg , and initially catalogued as 1904 ny . where its name came from is not known ; it may be named after the mythical hercules , or after an unknown woman of that name . most of the asteroids found by wolf around this date were named for characters in operas , but if this name was also drawn from such a source , no explanation has been recorded . herculina is one of the twenty or so biggest members of the main asteroid belt . it has often been noted for its complex lightcurves , which made finding its shape and rotation somewhat hard . a set of 1982 speckle inferometry observations led to a simple preliminary model of herculina as a three-axis object , perhaps 260 by 220 by 215 km . 1985 analysis of this data concluded there was a nonspherical shape with one bright spot , whilst a 1987 photometric astrometry study concluded the object was spherical with two dark spots ( and rotated around a completely different pole ) , which was in turn negated by a 1988 thermal study which showed the object could not be spherical . by the late 1980s , the generally accepted model was a three-axis object with major albedo or topographical features .
