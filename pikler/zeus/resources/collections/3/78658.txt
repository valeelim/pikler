Moorland     moorland or moor is a type of habitat that one can find in upland areas , that are characterised by acidic soils . moorland habitats are rather common in the neotropics and tropical africa but one can find them also in small scattered places in northern and western europe , northern australia , north america , central asia and the indian subcontinent . in the tiny areas of european moorlands tend to be environments with only very few species . they are often dominated by heather . in the far more extensive moorlands of the tropics species diversity can be extremely high . moorlands differ from typical heathland in being colder and much wetter , often with extensive bogs . notable areas of upland moorland in britain include the dark peak , the forest of bowland , the lake district , the pennines , mid wales , the southern uplands of scotland , the scottish highlands and a few very small pockets in western herefordshire . - bleaklow , dark peak , england - bodmin moor , cornwall - curry and hay moors , somerset , england
