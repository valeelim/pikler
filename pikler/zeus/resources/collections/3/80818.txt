Enrico Fermi     enrico fermi ( september 29 , 1901 — november 28 , 1954 ) was an italian-american physicist who worked on the first nuclear reactor and helped make quantum theory . he also was important to particle physics , and statistical mechanics . fermi won the nobel prize in physics in 1938 for his work on induced radioactivity . he built the world 's first nuclear reactor . fermi was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century . fermi was born in rome and went to a local grammar school . he was very good at maths and science and won a prize from scuola normale superiore of pisa . he went to the university of pisa where he studied physics . in 1923 he was given a scholarship from the italian government and went to göttingen for more study . he was given a rockefeller scholarship in 1924 and studied in leyden . he came back to italy at the end of 1924 and became lecturer in mathematical physics and mechanics at the university of florence . in 1926 , fermi discovered the statistical laws , now called fermi statistics . these laws explain the actions of the particles which are subject to the pauli exclusion principle , which are now called fermions . these are different to the particles called bosons which are explained by bose-einstein statistics . in 1927 he became professor of theoretical physics at the university of rome . he spent time studying electrodynamics , and began to closely look at the atomic nucleus . in 1934 , using discoveries made by wolfgang pauli , frédéric joliot , irène joliot-curie , he was able to show changes in almost every element bombarded with neutrons . this led to the discovery of slow neutrons , nuclear fission and making elements that were not in the periodic table .
