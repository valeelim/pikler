Great Dark Spot     the great dark spot ( also known as gds-89 ) is a dark spot on neptune similar in appearance to jupiter 's great red spot . it was discovered in 1989 by nasa 's `` voyager 2 '' probe . although it appears similar to jupiter 's spot , which is an anticyclonic storm ( this is like a hurricane ) , it is believed that the great dark spot is an atmospheric hole similar to the hole in earth 's ozone layer . however , the insides of great dark spots are mostly cloud-free , and unlike jupiter 's spot , which has lasted for hundreds of years , their lifetimes appear to be much shorter , forming and disappearing once every few years or so . based on pictures taken by voyager and since then with the hubble space telescope , neptune appears to spend a little bit more than half its time with a great dark spot . the dark , elliptically-shaped spot ( with initial dimensions of 13,000 × 6,600 km , or 8,100 × 4,100 mi ) was about the same size as earth , and was similar looking to jupiter 's great red spot . around the great dark spot , winds were measured blowing up to 2,400 kilometers ( 1,500 miles ) an hour , the fastest in the solar system . the great dark spot is thought to be a hole in the methane cloud deck of neptune . the spot was seen at different times with different sizes and shapes .
