52 Europa     52 europa is an asteroid . it has a diameter of 289 km , and was found on february 4 , 1858 by h. goldschmidt . it is named after europa , one of zeus 's conquests in greek mythology . europa is the seventh biggest asteroid by volume and the sixth biggest by mass ( after ceres , vesta , pallas , hygiea , and interamnia ) and contains somewhat less than 2 % of the mass of the entire main belt . it is a very dark carbonaceous c-type , and the fourth-biggest of these . it orbits close to the hygiea asteroid family , but is not a member . spectroscopic studies have found evidence of olivines and pyroxenes on the surface . lightcurve data for europa has been very hard to interpret , so much so for a long time its period of rotation was in dispute ( 5 and a half , or 11 hours ? ) despite many observations . it has now been determined that europa is a prograde rotator , but the exact direction in which its pole points remains unclear . the most detailed analysis indicates that it points either towards about ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( 70° , 55° ) or ( 40° , 255° ) with a 10° uncertainty . this gives an axial tilt of about 14° or 54° , respectively .
