Districts of Switzerland     in switzerland each canton is free to decide its own internal organisation . because of this there many types and names for smaller administrative divisions in each canton . the term district is used for these smaller divisions . most cantons are divided into `` bezirke '' ( german for districts ) . some are called `` ämter '' ( lucerne ) , `` amtsbezirke '' ( bern ) , `` district '' ( in french ) or `` distretto '' ( tessin and part of graubünden ) . the bezirke generally only deals with administration and court organization . the cantons graubünden and schwyz are their own legal entities . they have the power to control taxes as well . ten of the 26 cantons entirely dispense with the district level of government : uri , obwalden , nidwalden , appenzell ausserrhoden , glarus , zug , basel-city and geneva . schaffhausen stopped using bezirke in the middle of 1999. since the start of 2003 canton of st. gallen does not use the bezirk level any more . the canton of zürich is divided into 12 districts ( german : `` bezirke '' ) . the city of zürich is its own district .
