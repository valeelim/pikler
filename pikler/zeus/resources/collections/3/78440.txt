Troposphere     the troposphere is the lowest part of earth 's atmosphere . it contains about 75 % of the atmosphere 's mass and 99 % of its water vapor and aerosols . its height is about 15 km . it is taller in the tropics ( 20 km ) and shorter at the poles ( 7 km ) . the troposphere is where earth 's weather like rain , snow , thunder , or storms occur . clouds can form up to a height of 10â€“15 km . the troposphere is where people live , because it reaches down to ground level . the next layer up is called the stratosphere . between the two layers there is the tropopause . in the troposphere , the temperature goes down as the altitude increases . this is different from the stratosphere . this also means that the troposphere is quite unstable : gases can easily rise up or fall down . hence the troposphere is well mixed . this vigorous atmospheric convection also causes the general atmospheric circulation . other websites . - troposphere citizendium
