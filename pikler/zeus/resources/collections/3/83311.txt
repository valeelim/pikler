Comet West     comet west was a spectacular comet , also considered to qualify for `` great comet '' status . it was discovered through pictures by richard m. west , of the european southern observatory , on august 10 , 1975. during peak brightness , observers reported that it was bright enough to study during full daylight . comet west was what 1973 's comet kohoutek should have been . the comet has an estimated orbital period of 558,000 years . during the comet 's run into the closer part of the solar system for the first time in 500,000 years , the nucleus of comet west was seen to split into four pieces as it passed within 30 million km . of the sun . the first report of the split came around 7 march 1976 12:30ut , when reports were received that the comet had broken into two pieces . these two pieces remained the only pieces until steven o'meara , using the 9-inch harvard refractor , reported that two additional pieces had formed on the morning of 18 march . the breakup was one of very few comet breakups seen from historical times by the 1970s . recently , comets shoemaker-levy 9 , schwassmann-wachmann-3 ( 73/p ) , c/1999 s4 linear , and 57/p du toit-neujmin-delporte , have been seen to disintegrate . when seen , many were stunned , but none more so than the discoverer , richard martin west . the comet broke into pieces when some distance from the sun . it exploded into four pieces , and those were scattered . later , two pieces were spotted , and studied intently by astronomers .
