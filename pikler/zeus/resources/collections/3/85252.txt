Christian right     the christian right ( known as the religious right in the united states ) is the name for right-wing christian political and social movements . though they exist in other countries , such as canada , it is most commonly used to talk about the united states . these groups are characterized by their strong support of conservative social and political values . usually , this comes from a belief that the united states was founded on a strong belief in god , and that american laws and policies should be based on what is in the bible . though members of the christian right can be from any branch of christianity , including catholicism , the religious right is most often used with evangelical christians , fundamentalists ( such as born-agains ) and mormons . about 15 % of americans say they are part of the christian or religious right . people who have been conservative due to their religion have been in the united states for hundreds of years . for example , the people who put john scopes on trial would be called as members of the religious right . however , the term first came into use in the 1970s by jerry falwell . he and others felt that the country and its institutions ( such as schools and colleges ) were run by left-wing intellectuals who did not believe in god , and that in reality most people believed in god and did not care for left-wing intellectuals . the fight between left-wing intellectuals and the religious right is often called the `` culture wars '' .
