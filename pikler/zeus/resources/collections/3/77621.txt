Cladistics     cladistics is the method of classifying organisms into groups called clades . a clade ( greek = branch ) is a group of organisms with a common ancestor and all its descendants ( and nothing else ) . such a clade is monophyletic . the term 'clade ' was coined by english biologist julian huxley . birds , dinosaurs , crocodiles , and all other descendants ( living or extinct ) of their most recent common ancestor form a clade . in the terms of biological systematics , a clade is a single branch on the tree of life , a monophyletic group . biological classification needs such a natural group of organisms to be put together and given a taxonomic name . this brings classification in line with phylogeny ( how living things evolved ) . in cladistics , clades are the only acceptable units . some versions of cladistics have been the subject of controversy . the term `` clade '' was introduced in 1958 by julian huxley , `` cladistic '' by cain and harrison in 1960 , and `` cladist '' ( for an adherent of hennig 's school ) by mayr in 1965. hennig referred to his own approach as `` phylogenetic systematics '' . from the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1980s cladistics remained a minority approach to classification .
