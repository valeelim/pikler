History of the United Kingdom     the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland is the sovereign state . england , scotland , wales ( together great britain ) and northern ireland are parts of this state . it began to take its present shape with the acts of union in 1707 , which united the crowns and parliaments of england and scotland to create the kingdom of great britain . a further act of union in 1800 joined the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland to create the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . in 1922 , the territory of what is now the republic of ireland gained independence , and only northern ireland continued to be part of the united kingdom . as a result , in 1927 britain changed its formal title to `` the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' , usually shortened to `` the united kingdom '' , `` the uk '' or `` britain '' . the first step towards political unification were taken on 1 may 1707 , shortly after the parliaments of scotland and england had approved acts of union which combined the two parliaments and the two royal titles .
