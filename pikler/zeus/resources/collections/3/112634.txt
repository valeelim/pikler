Swarm intelligence     swarm intelligence is a field of computer science . it is a form of artificial intelligence . some animals , mostly insects like ants , or bees form large colonies . these colonies are made of many animals that communicate with each other . each animal is relatively simple , but by working together with other animals it is able to solve complex tasks . swarm intelligence wants to obtain similar behaviour than that observed with these animals . instead of the animals , so called `` agents '' are used .
