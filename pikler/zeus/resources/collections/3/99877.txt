Trojan asteroid     trojan objects orbit 60° ahead ( l4 ) or behind ( l5 ) a more massive object . both are in orbit around an even more massive central object . the best known example are the asteroids that orbit ahead or behind jupiter around the sun . trojan objects do not orbit exactly at one of either lagrange points , but do remain close to it , appearing to slowly orbit it . the largest group of asteroids known to move around the sun are those with the planet jupiter . there are two groups of jovian trojans , one group on each side of jupiter . in 1772 the french mathematician and astronomer joseph-louis lagrange identified two spots in a planet 's orbit which were gravitationally stable . if put there , an object would stay there . lagrange predicted the existence of a group of small bodies in each of the two stable points in jupiter ’ s orbit . the term originally referred to the trojan asteroids orbiting around jupiter 's lagrangian points , which are by convention named after figures from the trojan war of greek mythology . by convention , the asteroids orbiting jupiter 's l point are named after the heroes from the greek side of the war , while those at l are from the trojan side . the two exceptions , the greek-themed 617 patroclus and the trojan-themed 624 hektor , were actually assigned to the wrong sides .
