Church music     church music is music that is intended to be part of christian worship in churches , chapels , cathedrals or anywhere christians meet to worship . church music is sacred ( religious ) music , but not all religious music is church music . some music may be inspired by religion , but it may not be church music . for example , some songs are about religion , but they may not be church music . although it uses the words of the requiem mass , verdi ’ s `` requiem '' , was composed for performance in a concert hall . britten ’ s `` war requiem '' was written for performance in a cathedral , but it was not meant to be part of a service of worship , so it would not usually be thought of as “ church music ” . church music has varied enormously during the history of christianity as different churches kept changing their ideas about what part music should have in religious worship . most church music is based on singing . music written for church choirs mostly used the words of the liturgy ( the words used in services ) . the organ is the most important musical instrument in church music , although from time to time many other instruments have been used as well .
