Triple Alliance (1882)    triple alliance ( 1882 ) the triple alliance was a military alliance ( agreement to fight together ) between germany , austria-hungary , and italy , that lasted from 1882 until the start of world war i in 1914. the three countries promised to help each other if another country attacked them . some italian people were not happy about the agreement because austria-hungary was an old enemy . in 1914 , the triple alliance and the triple entente ( france , russia and the united kingdom ) started world war i. in 1915 , italy left the alliance and fought against austria-hungary and germany from 1916. the triple alliance had many strong points but also negative ones . the positive ones were : the alliance included two very powerful countries which were industrialised but the negatives were that if war were to be declared they would be encircled by the triple entente ( france , russia , and britain ) . that would mean that they would have to divide their troops in two which would make the germans much weaker .
