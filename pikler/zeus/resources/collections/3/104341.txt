Blackletter     blackletter or gothic script is an old way to write . blackletter in writing or print was used in western europe from about 1150 to the 17th century . it was used for printing in germany until the 20th century . letter shapes in printing were copied from letter shapes in a style of handwriting . so , the gothic script of northern europe and the latin script used in italy were both copied into print typography . some people call blackletter old english . this is not right , because old english is a language , not a script , and many centuries older . also `` gothic '' script has nothing to do with the goths . they lived in central europe from the 3rd to 6th century and wrote in runes . blackletter must not be confused either with the ancient gothic alphabet or with the sans-serif typefaces that are also sometimes called `` gothic '' . the term `` gothic '' was first used to describe this script in fifteenth century italy , in the midst of the renaissance . scholars thought it was a barbaric script : `` gothic '' was a synonym for `` barbaric '' .
