Body dysmorphic disorder     body dysmorphic disorder ( bdd ) is a mental problem where people think they look different to how they really look . people are usually said to have bdd if they are extremely critical of their body , even though there may be nothing noticeably wrong with it . if there is something wrong with their body , it is usually so small that a person without bdd would not be unhappy about it at all . people claim that they are insecure , but bdd is far worse . most people without bdd may not like some parts of their body , but people with bdd believe that they are so ugly , even though they are not , that they find it difficult to talk or exist with other people , or live normally , scared that other people will be mean to them because of the way they look . people with bdd often do not look for help because they are afraid others will think they are just vain , or they may feel too embarrassed to talk to other people as they think they are so ugly . bdd is a somatoform disorder . people with bdd may look at themselves in the mirror too much , or some people with bdd may actually try not to look in the mirror . both of these are possible for a person with bdd . they usually think about their body for more than one hour per day , and in bad cases , can stop talking to other people , and may stay at home . people with bdd often have very low self-confidence , because they believe that a person 's value is linked to what they look like , and because they do not think that they are beautiful themselves , they do not think they have much value .
