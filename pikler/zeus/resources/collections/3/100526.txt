French Constitution of 1791     the french constitution of 1791 was the second written constitution of france . it was an important result of the french revolution and adopted the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen as its introduction . this constitution meant the creation of a french constitutional monarchy . the main controversy was the level of power to be granted to the king of france in such a system . after very long negotiations , the long expected first constitution was brought in september of 1791. although it helped make the constitutional monarchy , the king fled to varennes due to the radicalism of jacobins . the principle of separation of powers was the basis for the constitution : the national convention was the legislative body , the king and the ministers made up the executive branch and the judicial branch was independent from the other two . however , the french revolution still continued after this document was signed . the constitution attempted to establish a liberal bourgeois constitutional monarchy , but this did not work out . on 10 august 1792 the monarchy of france ended .
