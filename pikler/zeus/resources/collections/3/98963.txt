Elapid     the elapidae , or elapids , are a family of venomous snakes . these snakes can be found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world . they can also be found in the indian ocean and the pacific . they are characterized by a set of hollow , fixed fangs through which they inject venom . there are snakes of different sizes , from only 18 cm ( `` drysdalia '' ) up to 6 m in length ( `` king cobra '' ) . currently , 61 genera with 231 species are known . those elapids that live on land look a lot like the colubrids : almost all have long and slender bodies with smooth scales , a head that is covered with large shields and not always distinct from the neck , and eyes with round pupils . in addition , their behavior is usually quite active and most are oviparous . there are exceptions to all these generalizations : for example , the death adders ( `` acanthophis '' ) include short and fat , rough-scaled , very broad-headed , cat-eyed , live-bearing , sluggish ambush predators with partly fragmented head shields . some species spend most of their lives in trees or bushes ; this is called arboreal ( african `` pseudohaje '' and `` dendroaspis '' , australian `` hoplocephalus '' ) . many others are specialised burrowers ( e.g . `` ogmodon '' , `` parapistocalamus '' , `` simoselaps '' , `` toxicocalamus '' , `` vermicella '' ) . some species have very generalised diets . others have specialised on a certain kind of prey . they have also adapted themselves , to better be able to feed on other snakes , certain lizards , squamate eggs , mammals , birds , frogs , fish , etc .
