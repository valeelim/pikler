Metic     in ancient greece , a metic ( greek : `` metoikos '' ) was a foreigner living in a greek city-state ( `` polis '' ) . the metic did not have the same citizen rights as a citizen who was born in the state he was living in . the term 'metic ' was especially used in ancient athens in the 4th and 5th centuries bc . a notable metic was aristotle , who was born in stageira but lived in athens for a long time . regardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city , metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift . this was rarely done . citizenship at athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay , which could be significant to working people . during emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens . none of these rights were available to metics . they were not permitted to own real estate in attica , whether farm or house , unless granted a special exemption . metics shared the burdens of citizenship without any of its privileges . like citizens , they had to perform military service and , if rich enough , were subject to special tax contributions . citizenship was very rarely granted to metics . more common was the special status of `` equal rights '' ( `` isoteleia '' ) under which they were freed from the usual liabilities .
