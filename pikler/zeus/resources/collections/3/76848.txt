Pneumatics     pneumatics is the use of pressurized air for mechanical motion . it is used in different contexts . pneumatic transfer systems are employed in many industries to move powders and devices . pneumatic devices are also used where electric motors can not be used for safety reasons , such as deep in a mine where explosive dust or gases may be present . examples of pneumatic tools . - pneumatic drill ( jackhammer ) used by road workers - pneumatic nailgun - pneumatic switches - pneumatic actuators - air compressors - vacuum pumps - barostat systems used in neurogastroenterology and for researching electricity - cable jetting - a way to install cables in ducts - pneumatic mail systems - air brakes on buses , trains , and trucks both pneumatics and hydraulics are applications of fluid power . pneumatics uses air , which is compressible , while hydraulics uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil or water . advantages of pneumatics . - the working fluid is very light in weight so supply hoses are not heavy .
