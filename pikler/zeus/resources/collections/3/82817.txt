Boeing 787 Dreamliner     the boeing 787 dreamliner is an aircraft made by boeing . its first flight took place on 15 december 2009. it was planned to be released earlier , but the first passenger flight of the airplane was in october 2011. because of this some airlines will get their aircraft nearly 30 months late . the aircraft has had some problems . it is being reviewed by the faa and the japanese aviation agency . on january 16 , 2013 , the faa said that all 787s were not allowed to fly in the u.s. the easa , japanese transport ministry , india 's directorate general of civil aviation ( dgca ) , and chile 's direcci√≥n general de aeronautica civil ( dgac ) also said that the 787 was not allowed to fly in their country . in the late 1990s boeing wanted to make a plane called the sonic cruiser , which would go very fast . according to boeing , the 787 consumes 20 % less fuel than the similarly-sized 767. but after the september 11 , 2001 attacks fuel prices went up , so airlines wanted more efficient planes rather than faster ones . boeing cancelled the sonic cruiser and replaced it in january 2003 with the `` 7e7 , '' which was the code name for the 787 at the time . in july 2003 , boeing decided to call the new plane the `` dreamliner .
