Digital signal     digital signal can mean two different things : 1 . `` discrete-time signals '' that are digitized . 1. the waveform signals in a digital system . digital signals are digital representations of `` discrete-time signals '' , which are often produced by changing an analog signal . an analog signal is a datum that changes over time ( for instance the temperature at a given place ; the depth of a certain point in a pond ; or the amplitude of the voltage at some node in a circuit ) . a discrete-time signal is a sampled version of an analog signal : the value of the datum is noted at fixed intervals ( for example , every microsecond ) rather than continuously . in short , a digital signal is a quantized discrete-time signal ; a discrete-time signal is a sampled analog signal . in the digital revolution , the usage of digital signals has increased significantly . many modern media devices , especially the ones that connect with computers use digital signals to represent signals that were traditionally represented as analog signals ; cell phones , music and video players , personal video recorders , and digital cameras are examples .
