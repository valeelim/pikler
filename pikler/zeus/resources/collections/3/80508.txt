Adrastea (moon)    adrastea ( moon ) adrastea or ' , is the second closest moon to jupiter . it was found by david c. jewitt and g. edward danielson in `` voyager 2 '' probe photographs taken in 1979 and received the designation ' . in 1983 , it was named after the mythological adrastea , who was a daughter of jupiter and ananke . adrastea was the first moon to be found from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft , rather than through telescopic photography . adrastea is non-spherical and measures 20x16x14 km³ across . what adrastea is made of and the mass of adrastea are not known , but assuming that its mean density is like that of amalthea ( ~0.86 g/cm³ ) its mass can be estimated at ~2×10 kg . amalthea 's density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10-15 % , and adrastea may be similar . no surface details of adrastea are known , due to the low resolution of available images . adrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the closer moons to jupiter . it orbits jupiter at ~129,000 km ( 1.806 jupiter radii ) within the planet 's main ring . the orbital eccentricity of ~0.0015 and inclination of ~ 0.03° relative to the equator of jupiter are very small .
