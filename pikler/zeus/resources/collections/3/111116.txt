Mission statement     a mission statement tells the purpose of a company or organization . basically , it says in a very short way who the organization does something for , what is the kind of thing it does , and which way it does it ( that is , instead of other ways one could do that same thing ) . it can be used to tell quickly what the organization does . it can also help to give members of the organization a common idea of what they 're here to do . a mission statement basically sums up everything that something is about . put very simply , for a performance it would sum up what the purpose of the performance is . that might be to entertain . examples : mcdonald 's - mission statement : `` to provide the fast food customer food prepared in the same high-quality manner world-wide that is tasty , reasonably-priced & delivered consistently in a low-key d√©cor and friendly atmosphere . '' - who : people who want fast food , all over the world - what : good food that tastes good and does n't cost too much ( well ... ) - which way : the same way anywhere , no bells and whistles in the shop , but friendly employees there .
