Equus (genus)    equus ( genus ) equus is a genus of mammals in the family equidae . it includes horses , asses , and zebras . `` equus '' is the only living ( extant ) genus of horses , and there are seven living species . they are the one-toed horses , and are adapted for living in various types of grasslands . the term equine refers to any member of this genus . `` equus '' has many extinct species known only from fossils . the genus most likely originated in north america and spread quickly to the old world . equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs , long heads , relatively long necks , manes ( erect in most subspecies ) and long tails . all species are herbivorous , and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants . they can live on low-quality vegetation . feral equine populations are widespread , but wild equines are found only in africa and asia . wild populations may have a harem system . in this case one adult male or `` stallion '' , several females or `` mares '' and their young or `` foals '' . otherwise they live in a territory where males control territories with resources that attract females . in both systems , females take care of the foals , though males may play a role as well . equines communicate with each other visually and vocally . human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species , only the plains zebra is still widespread and abundant .
