90 Antiope     90 antiope is an asteroid found on october 1 , 1866 by robert luther . the 90th asteroid to be found , it is named after antiope from greek mythology , though it is disputed as to whether the namesake is antiope the amazon or antiope the mother of amphion and zethus . antiope orbits in the farther third of the core region of the main belt , and is a member of the themis family of asteroids . like most bodies in this region , it is of the dark c spectral type , indicating that it is made of carbonaceous chondrite . one seen stellar occultation by antiope has been reported , on june 11 , 1980. the most remarkable feature of antiope is that it has two asteroids of almost equal size ( the difference in mass is less than 2.5 % ) , making it a truly `` double '' asteroid . its binary nature was found on 10 august , 2000 by a group of astronomers using adaptive optics at the keck telescope on mauna kea . the `` secondary '' is designated s/2000 ( 90 ) 1. each asteroid is about 86±1 km across , with their centers separated by only about 170 kilometers . this means that the space separating the two halves is only 60 km , or so . the two bodies orbit around the same center of mass which lies in the space between them . the orbital period is about 16.50 hours , the eccentricity below 0.03 ( best estimate 0.01 ± 0.02 ) . every several years , a period of mutual occultations occurs when the asteroid is viewed from earth . using kepler 's third law , the mass and density of the asteroids can be derived from the orbital period and asteroid sizes .
