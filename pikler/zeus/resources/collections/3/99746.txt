Dial-up     dial-up internet access , usually just called dial-up , is a slow way of connecting to the internet by using a telephone line . a modem is connected between a computer and a telephone line and then the modem is instructed to dial the phone number of an internet service provider ( isp ) to connect to the internet . the isp must be a dial-up service provider with several dial-up modems waiting to accept dial-up calls . this kind of internet is slower than dsl . it is not widely used in the united states , where only one out of every ten people still use it . in most parts of the world , the dial-up has been replaced by broadband . dial-up was the most common way of connecting to the internet from its creation until around the middle of the 2000s .
