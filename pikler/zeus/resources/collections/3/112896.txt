Buffer solution     a buffer solution is chemical solution which resists change to its ph or acidity . it is a solution in water of a mixture of a weak acid or base and its salt . the ph of the solution changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base is added to it . buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping ph at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications . many life forms have a relatively small ph range ; an example of a buffer solution is blood . buffer solutions may be of two types : acidic and basic . - acidic : a solution of a weak acid and its salt . - basic : a solution of a weak base and its salt . if you add acid to the solution , the concentration of h+ ions will increase ; to keep equilibrium a small number of ions will be combined ( forming salt and reducing the concentration of h+ ion in the solution ) . if you add base the concentration of h+ ion will reduce ( by consumption or combining ) and so a small amount of salt will break into ions and maintain the ph .
