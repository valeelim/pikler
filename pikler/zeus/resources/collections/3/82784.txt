31 Euphrosyne     31 euphrosyne is one of the biggest main belt asteroids , found by james ferguson on september 1 , 1854. it was the first asteroid found from north america . it is named after euphrosyne , one of the charites in greek mythology . it is the eighth biggest main belt asteroid and contains around 1 % of the mass of the entire asteroid belt , but is a very dark body near the belt 's farther edge . because of that , euphrosyne is never visible with binoculars , having a maximum magnitude at the best possible opposition of around +10.2 , which is actually fainter than any of the thirty asteroids previously found . it has not been studied a lot despite being one of the biggest asteroids . it is a normal c-type asteroid with a primitive surface . its orbit , however , is quite unusual . it 's orbit is similar to that of 2 pallas in its high inclination and eccentricity . whereas pallas and eris - the only bigger bodies with comparably tilted orbits - have nodes near perihelion and aphelion , euphrosyne 's perihelion lies at the northernmost point of its orbit . during a rare perihelic opposition euphrosyne is very high in the sky from northern latitudes , but invisible from such countries as new zealand and chile .
