Group theory     in mathematics and abstract algebra , group theory studies a type of algebraic structure called a group . group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures , and of addition and multiplication of numbers . because group theory is also useful for studying symmetry in nature and abstract systems , it has many applications in physics and chemistry . a group is a set ( collection ) `` g '' whose members are called `` elements '' . the elements can be numbers of some kind , or other abstract objects . the elements can even be material objects . there is also a `` binary operation '' which combines any two elements of `` g '' and results in another element of `` g '' . this new element may be different from either of the original two , but it does not have to be . it only has to be an element of `` g '' . to be a group , the following four conditions must be true of `` g '' and the operation defined over `` g '' : - `` closure '' : it is required to check if the suggested operation is actually an operation on the set . if an operation is used on any elements in the group , the element that is formed will also be part of the group .
