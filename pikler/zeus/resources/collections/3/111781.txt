Egerton Gospel     the egerton gospel is a set of papyri that are now in the british museum . the papyri have been dated to the second century . the text they contain may have been written 50-100 ad . it is one of the oldest known fragments of any gospel , or any codex . soon after the british museum acquired it in the summer of 1934 , it was printed in 1935. it is also called the unknown gospel , as no ancient source makes reference to it , in addition to being entirely unknown before its publication . the surviving fragments include four stories : 1. a controversy similar to john 5:39-47 and 10:31-39 ; 1. curing a leper similar to matt 8:1-4 , mark 1:40-45 , luke 5:12-16 and luke 17:11-14 ; 1. a controversy about paying tribute to caesar analogous to matt 22:15-22 , mark 12:13-17 , luke 20:20-26 ; 1. an incomplete account of a miracle on the jordan river bank , perhaps carried out to illustrate the parable about seeds growing miraculously . the last story has no equivalent in canonical gospels : other websites .
