John Keats     john keats ( 31 october 1795 â€“ 23 february 1821 ) was an english poet . he is often ranked as one of the five most important poets of the romantic movement in english literature ; the other four are william wordsworth , samuel taylor coleridge , lord byron , and percy bysshe shelley . though keats was the youngest of these poets , he also died before the others : he suffered from tuberculosis and died in rome at the age of 25. keats was the son of an inn-keeper thomas keats , who died when keats was nine years old and frances keats ; and his mother died of tuberculosis in 1810. the young keats began studying to be a surgeon , though his interest in literature grew stronger than his interest in medicine . he became a friend and follower of the poet and editor james henry leigh hunt , and made his first attempts to write his own poetry . keats 's active writing life lasted only about six years , from the spring of 1814 through 1819. his short life meant that he wrote less than many other poets . his longest poems , `` endymion '' and `` hyperion '' , tell stories from ancient greek mythology . many of his shorter poems are among the best known in english literature , including the ballad `` la belle dame sans merci '' and his sonnets and odes .
