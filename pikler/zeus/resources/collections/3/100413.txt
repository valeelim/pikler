Discrete cosine transform     a discrete cosine transform is a math process that can be used to make things like mp3s , and jpegs smaller . it does this by breaking the sound or picture into different frequencies . one way to calculate a discrete cosine transform is to use the fourier transformation . `` discrete '' means that it works on discrete-time signals ( sampled data ) . for sounds , frequencies are the same as simple tones . you can make any sound by playing several tones at the same time . the discrete cosine transform is a way to find out which tones to play in order to make a given sound . the only difference between the tones is their pitch . human ears are good at hearing low pitches , but bad at hearing high pitches . if you use the dct to break a sound into tones , you do not need to be as careful when playing the higher tones because people can not hear them as well . mp3 encoders ( programs which make mp3s ) use this fact to make the sound smaller . with pictures , frequencies are like stripes and checker patterns . just like with sound , you can make any picture out of different frequencies . also like sound , people 's eyes are not as good at seeing high frequencies ( hard edges and fine grain ) as low frequencies ( solid colors and smooth shades ) . jpeg encoders use this fact almost exactly the same way as mp3 encoders do .
