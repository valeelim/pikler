Habitat fragmentation     habitat fragmentation happens when large habitats are divided into smaller ones , separating all the species that lived there and depended on each other . habitat fragmentation is not good because it involves some amount of habitat destruction . plants and other organisms in these areas are destroyed and mobile animals escape from those places to find another habitat causing an excessive crowding and possible competitions among different animals .
