Fate (opera)    fate ( opera ) fate ( in czech : `` osud '' ) , is an opera by the czech composer leoš janáček . janáček wrote this opera between 1903 and 1905. his daughter olga had died shortly before he began to compose it . he had also just finished his opera `` jenůfa '' which has a tragic ending for the young girl in the story . the young lady who wrote the libretto ( words ) for janáček had been one of his daughter ’ s close friends . she wrote using the name tálská . janáček thought the opera had autobiographical ideas . he also wanted a change from writing about simple , country people as he had done in `` jenůfa '' , so the people in the story of `` fate '' belong to the upper classes , the rich people of society . the story of the opera is quite strange and unbelievable . it has often been criticized for not being logical . the story consists of lots of little scenes which make the story jump about . the language of the libretto is very deliberately old-fashioned . czech people who have worked with this opera have often felt that this formal language has made it hard for audiences to understand . some people have felt that when the opera is sung in other languages it is sometimes better because the language sounds more real .
