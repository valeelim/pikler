Manchukuo     manchukuo was a japanese puppet state in manchuria and eastern inner mongolia ruled by the former emperor of china henry pu-yi . despite pu-yi being emperor of manchukuo , he practically had no power , but he was put in place by the japanese to justify japan 's taking of chinese land , since the region is home to the former qing emperor 's ancestors . it was created by japan in 1932 because japan wanted to occupy manchuria 's rich natural resources but did not wish to declare war on china yet . most nations in the world did not recognize manchukuo as a country . manchukuo made its own money and it was called the manchukuo yuan . the capital of manchukuo was shinkyō ( japanese : 新京 , english : `` new capital '' ) , which is modern-day changchun . other websites . - ww2db : mukden incident and manchukuo
