Oasis     in geography , an oasis is an isolated place in the desert where there is vegetation . most often , this occurs around a source of water . oases provide a habitat for animals and are used as a source of water for humans . the knowledge of the location of oases has been important for trade and transportation routes in desert areas . caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be refilled . thus , political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route . for example , the oases of awjila , ghadames and kufra , in modern-day libya , have at various times been vital to both north-south and east-west trade in the sahara desert . the word `` oasis '' came into english via greek ὄασις , which was borrowed from egyptian `` wḥ3t '' or demotic `` wḥỉ '' . it was not borrowed from coptic `` ouaḥe '' ( */waħe/ ) , as is sometimes suggested ; the greek word is attested several centuries before coptic existed as a written language .
