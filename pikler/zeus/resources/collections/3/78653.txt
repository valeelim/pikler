Deposition (geology)    deposition ( geology ) deposition is the geological process where material is added to a landform . this happens quite often . some parts of a shoreline build up and grow out , whereas other parts of the shoreline erode and fall into the sea . in deposition , wind and water lay down grains of material that has been eroded and transported from another place . deposition happens when the forces which transport sediments are weaker than the forces of particle weight and friction . this causes a resistance to movement , and the particles drop down . deposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived matter or chemical process . related pages . - sediment - sedimentary rock
