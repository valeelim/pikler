Hyperinflation     in economics , hyperinflation is inflation that is `` out of control , '' when prices increase very fast as money loses its value . one example of hyperinflation is in germany in the 1920s . in 1922 , the largest bank note was 50,000 mark , in 1923 the largest bank note was 100,000,000,000,000 mark . in december of 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000 marks to 1 us dollar . these bank notes were so worthless that people would burn them in fires to keep them warm . the notes would burn longer than the amount of wood you could buy with them . sometimes the rate of inflation was so high that prices `` doubled '' every two days . the rentenmark was introduced to stop this problem . the exchange rate was set at 4.2 rentenmarks to 1 us dollar . in zimbabwe , the inflation rate was 231,150,888.87 % in july 2008 .
