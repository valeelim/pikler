Loop Current     part of the gulf stream , the loop current is a warm ocean current in the gulf of mexico that flows northward between cuba and the yucat√°n peninsula , moves north into the gulf of mexico , loops west and south before exiting to the east through the florida straits . around 1970 , it was believed that the loop current exhibited an annual cycle in which the loop feature extended farther to the north during the summer . further study over the past few decades , however , has shown that the extension to the north ( and the shedding of eddies ) does not have a significant annual cycle . the loop current and its eddies may be detected by measuring sea surface level . sea surface level of both the eddies and the loop on september 21 , 2005 was up to higher than surrounding water , indicating a deep area of warm water beneath them .
