Concubinage     concubinage is the state of a woman in a relationship with a man of higher social status that gives her less rights than a marriage . in most of the cases the man has an official wife and one or more concubines . concubines have only limited rights of support from the man , and their children have lower status than children born by the official wife or wives ; these legal rights distinguish a concubine from a mistress . historically , the family of a girl were in favour of a concubinage with an mighty man , as it meant economic security for the woman . but concubinage could also mean sexual slavery of one member of the relationship , typically the woman , who was a pleasure slave to the man . in the western world there is no legal status of concubines , as only monogamous marriages are allowed . any other relationship does not enjoy legal protection ; the woman is necessarily a mistress . references . - `` rosales v. battle '' ( 2003 ) 113 cal.app.4th 1178 ( california court decision involving status of concubine . link requires free registration . )
