Sandal (footwear)    sandal ( footwear ) sandals are an open type of footwear , consisting of a sole held to the wearer 's foot by straps or thongs passing over the instep and around the ankle . while the distinction between sandals and other types of footwear can sometimes be blurry ( as in the case of `` huaraches '' —the woven leather footwear seen in mexico ) , the common understanding is that a sandal reveals most or all of the foot ( especially the toes ) to view . people may choose to wear sandals for several reasons , among them economy ( sandals tend to require less material than shoes ) , comfort in warm weather , and ( especially for women ) for reasons of fashion and attractiveness . usually , sandals are worn in warmer climates or during warmer parts of the year , because feet stay cool and dry . the chances of getting a fungal infection on the feet ( athlete 's foot ) is lower than with wearing an enclosed shoe , and wearing sandals may be part of treatment for a fungal foot infection . wearing sandals with socks is considered by many to be a faux pas .
