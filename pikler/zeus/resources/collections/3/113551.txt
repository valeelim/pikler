Pistosaurus     pistosaurus is a genus of marine sauropterygian reptiles . it is a nothosaur , a relative of the plesiosaurs . `` pistosaurus '' was a advanced nothosaur-like body with a plesiosaur-like head . is presently known only from the middle triassic . even if it is a nothosaur it is acknowledged to be closely related to the ancestors of plesiosaurs . the head also resembled that of a plesiosaur , but with the primitive palate of a nothosaur , and numerous , sharp teeth ideal for catching and eating fish . although it is unlikely that `` pistosaurus '' was a direct ancestor of the plesiosaurs , the mixture of features suggests that it was closely related to that group .
