Styrene     styrene is a certain organic chemical compound having the chemical formula ch . its chemical structure is made up of a vinyl group bonded onto a benzene ring . this benzene ring makes styrene an aromatic compound . at room temperature and pressure , styrene is a clear , colorless liquid . other names for styrene can be `` styrol '' , `` vinylbenzene '' , `` phenylethene '' , or `` phenylethylene '' . styrene is used in polymer chemistry as a monomer . this means many styrene molecules can bond together to make a larger molecule called polystyrene . polystyrene is a kind of polymer often used as a plastic . this kind of chemical reaction is called polymerization . styrene can also bond with other kinds of monomers to make other kinds of polymers called `` copolymers '' . for one example , styrene has been mixed with another monomer called 1,3-butadiene to make a copolymer which is a kind of synthetic rubber . for another example , styrene is mixed with acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene to make a copolymer plastic called abs ( acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ) .
