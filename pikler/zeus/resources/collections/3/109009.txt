Asteroid spectral types     asteroids are assigned a type based on spectral shape , color , and sometimes albedo . these types are thought to correspond to an asteroid 's surface composition . for small bodies which are not internally differentiated , the surface and internal compositions are presumably similar , while large bodies such as 1 ceres and 4 vesta are known to have internal structure . a list of types can be found at . the present-day classification was initiated by clark r. chapman , david morrison , and ben zellner in 1975 with three categories : c for dark carbonaceous objects , s for stony ( silicaceous ) objects , and u for those which did not fit into either c or s. this classification has since been expanded and clarified . a number of classification schemes are currently in existence , and while they strive to retain some mutual consistency , quite a few asteroids are sorted into different classes depending on the particular scheme . this is due to the use of different criteria for each approach . the two most widely used classifications are described below :
