Pansexuality     pansexual people are people attracted to people regardless of their gender . the word `` pansexual '' comes from the greek word 'pan- ' , meaning `` all '' . pansexual people are part of the lgbt community . bisexual people are attracted to both sexes ( males and females ) , usually to those who identify as boys or girls or as men or women , while pansexuality means attraction to people of any gender ( including those who may not identify as boys or girls or as men or women ) or to those who are intersex . some who identify as pansexual call themselves `` gender blind '' because they do not consider gender important when they are attracted to others . pansexuality is the opposite of asexuality , as pansexuality means a person may be sexually attracted to anyone , but asexuality means a person is sexually attracted to no one . however , pansexuals are not necessarily sexually attracted to everyone they meet , nor do they necessarily have strong sex drives . related pages . - homosexuality
