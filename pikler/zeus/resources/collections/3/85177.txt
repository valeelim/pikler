253 Mathilde     \end { align } < /math > < /ref > m/s² 253 mathilde is a main belt asteroid found by johann palisa in 1885. it has a fairly elliptical orbit that takes more than four years to circle the sun . this asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation , taking 17.4 days to complete a 360° revolution about its axis . it is a primitive c-type asteroid , which means the surface has lots of carbon ; giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4 % of the light that falls on it . this asteroid was visited by the near shoemaker spacecraft during june 1997 , on its way to asteroid 433 eros . the spacecraft took pictures a hemisphere of the asteroid , finding many big craters that have gouged out depressions in the surface . it is currently the biggest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft , and the first c-type asteroid to be so explored . 253 mathilde is very dark . the asteroid has a number of very big craters , with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world . the two biggest craters , ishikari ( 29.3 km ) and karoo ( 33.4 km ) , are as wide as the asteroid 's average radius . the impacts appear to have blown big volumes off the asteroid , as suggested by the angular edges of the craters .
