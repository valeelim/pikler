Gopher (search engine)    gopher ( search engine ) gopher is a protocol . it was designed for distributing , searching , and retrieving documents over the internet . gopher represented an early alternative to the world wide web . the gopher protocol has some things http-based clients do not have . it is based on menus . an item selected from a menu will either open another menu , or a document . because of concern over possible licensing fees , and the relative flexibility of the world wide web , the protocol did not get much use . there are less than 200 gopher servers still actively maintained . many of the remaining gopher servers are run by individuals . most of them are rarely updated except for the ones run by enthusiasts of the protocol . a handful of new servers are set up every year by hobbyists - over 50 have been set up and added to floodgap 's list since 1999. today gopher exists as an almost forgotten corner of the internet . - one can publish email addresses in plaintext without having to worry about spam , and publish large amounts of data without the risk of the server 's bandwidth becoming saturated by overuse .
