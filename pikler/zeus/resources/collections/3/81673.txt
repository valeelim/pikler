Naturalization     naturalization is when a person changes his or her nationality . most people have the nationality of the country where they are born and grow up . if they move to another country they will still keep their own nationality at first , but if they stay there for many years and want to stay there for the rest of their lives they may want to change their nationality . different countries have different laws about nationalization . usually the person will have to make a promise in a court of law . he will have to promise to be a good citizen and obey the country 's laws . sometimes , it is still possible for someone to keep their first nationality as well as getting a new one . this is called `` dual nationality '' . sometimes children whose parents have different nationalities are allowed to have dual nationality . someone who has been naturalized will normally have all the rights that any other person belonging to that country has .
