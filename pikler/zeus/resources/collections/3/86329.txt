Hair iron     a hair iron or hair tong is something people use to change the shape of the hair by heating it . there are three types of hair iron : - straightening irons ( sometimes called hair irons , hair straighteners or just straighteners ) , which straighten the hair . - curling tongs ( sometimes called hair tongs or hair curlers or just curlers , or less often curling irons ) , which make hair curly . - styling irons ( sometimes called hair stylers or just stylers ) , that can straighten and curl the hair . in 1872 , marcel grateau ( a parisian ) used heated rods to straighten or style hair . simon e. monroe patented a hair straightener in 1906 that was like a metal comb . in 1909 , issac k. shero patented a hair straightener made of two irons that are heated and put together around the hair . years later , sharrell made heated metal tools , for example : hot combs . the hot metal straightener went easily through the hair , making less damage and dryness than the way things were done before . later , ceramic and electrical straighteners were made , meaning people could adjust the heat settings and straightener size .
