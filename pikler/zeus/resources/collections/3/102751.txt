Druid     a druid was a member of the priestly and learned class in the pre-christian , ancient celtic societies . these societies existed through much of western europe , britain and ireland , until the roman government took over and , later , christianity arrived . druids were part of the cultures of the tribal peoples who were called `` keltoi '' ( `` κέλτοι '' ) or `` keltai '' ( `` κέλται '' ) and `` galatai '' ( `` γαλάται '' ) by the greeks and `` celtae '' and `` galli '' by the romans . in the communities they served , druids combined the duties of priest , , healer , scholar , and . both men and women served as druids , although there is no early proof for female druids , or druidesses . from what little we know of late druidic practices , it appears deeply traditional and conservative , in the sense that druids were conserving the old culture and for their communities . it is impossible now to judge whether this continuity had deep historical roots and originated in the social transformations of the late la tène culture , or whether there had been a discontinuity and then a religious innovation .
