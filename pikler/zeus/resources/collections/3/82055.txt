Ninety-Five Theses     the ninety-five theses on the power of indulgences , commonly known as the ninety-five theses , was written by martin luther . luther argued that the church should not sell indulgences . because many people agreed , luther became very popular , paving the way for the protestant reformation . on october 31 , 1517 , luther approached the church authorities with his pressing call for reform . on this day he presented them with his theses . when the bishops did not respond , luther circulated his theses privately . the theses spread quickly and were printed in nuremberg , leipzig , and basel . most recently , in february 2007 , the media reported that a handwritten note by luther 's secretary georg r√∂rer , found in the university library at jena , appeared to confirm the traditional account of luther 's nailing the theses to the door . as of february 2007 , this new find has yet to be assessed by scholars . bibliography . - erwin iserloh the theses were not posted : luther between reform and reformation . trans . by jared wicks , s.j.. boston : beacon press , 1968 .
