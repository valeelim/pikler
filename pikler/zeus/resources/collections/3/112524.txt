Metroid     `` metroid '' is the first game in the `` metroid '' series and stars the character samus aran . she later appears in all of the later games . `` metroid '' was one of the first non-linear video games . this means that it did not force players to play through the game in one way . players could explore and go to all of the areas in whatever order they wished . the basic gameplay is a mix of adventure , platform shooter , and action . the player controls the main character samus while exploring the game 's cave-like environment . because samus starts only with a weak attack and a short jump , players must find power-ups to make the attack and jump stronger , in order to get to new areas of the game . while there are many different small enemies that players meet , there are also large bosses who must be killed in order to reach the last level of the game .
