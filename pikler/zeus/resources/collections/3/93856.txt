Arthur Schlesinger Jr     arthur meier schlesinger , jr. , born arthur bancroft schlesinger ( october 15 , 1917 â€“ february 28 , 2007 ) , was an american historian and social critic . he was awarded the pulitzer prize . his work explored the liberalism of american political leaders , especially that of franklin d. roosevelt , john f. kennedy , and robert f. kennedy . he served as special assistant and court historian to the president in john f. kennedy 's administration . he wrote a lot about the kennedy administration . these writings have the title `` a thousand days '' . when the united states thought about invading cuba at the bay of pigs , he was one of only two people who opposed the invasion . the other was william fulbright . schlesinger sat silent , except for a private memorandum to the president . he did this , because he did not want to undermine the president 's desire for a unanimous decision . when it had become clear the invasion had failed , schlesinger later wrote : `` in the months after the bay of pigs , i bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room ... i can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that one 's impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion .
