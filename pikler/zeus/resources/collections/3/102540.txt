Book of Proverbs     the book of proverbs is a book in both the tanakh ( judaism ) , and the old testament ( christianity ) . the book contains some of the most important teaching and instructions in each of their respective religions . most scholars believe that solomon was the writer of at least part of the book . other authors are mentioned as well , but these references are missing in the greek septuagint . the septuagint sees king solomon as the author of the whole book of proverbs . in the middle ages , scholars thought the vulgate was a more faithful rendering of 30:1 and 31:1. in their eyes the words `` agur '' and `` lamuel '' were only other names for solomon . dates for the writing of the book are unclear . because of suggested authorship of solomon , and the workings of hezekiah 's men , there are some dates that can be worked with . however , there are not enough to give specific timing to the completion of the book , though it could have been as late as third century bc other websites . - the book of proverbs ( king james version )
