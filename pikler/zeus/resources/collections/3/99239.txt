Carlo Gesualdo     carlo gesualdo , known as gesualdo da venosa ( born probably 8 march 1566 ; died 8 september 1613 ) , prince of venosa and count of conza , was an italian music composer , lutenist and murderer . he lived in the late part of the renaissance period . he is famous for his beautifully expressive madrigals which are written in a very chromatic style ( using lots of sharps and flats ) . he is also remembered for committing a horrible murder . gesualdo came from an aristocratic family . he was probably born at venosa , but we know hardly anything about his early life . we know that he was extremely interested in music when he was small and showed very little interest in anything else . he played the lute , harpsichord and guitar . in 1586 gesualdo married his first cousin , donna maria d'avalos , the daughter of the marquis of pescara . two years later she began to have a love affair with fabrizio carafa , the duke of andria . for two years her husband knew nothing about her love affair . then one day he returned unexpectedly to his palace ( he may have suspected that something was happening ) and found them making love . he murdered them both in their bed . he then left their bodies in front of the palace for everyone to see . in those days in italy a nobleman could not be arrested and punished . however , someone might have wanted to kill him in revenge , so he ran away to the town of gesualdo where he had a castle .
