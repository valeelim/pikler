Control theory     control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics . it deals with the behavior of dynamical systems . the desired output of a system is called the `` reference '' . in a control system a controller manipulates the inputs to a system . in the control systems one or more output variables of a system need to follow a certain reference over time . by manipulating the input , the controller wants to obtain the desired effect on the output of the system . if we were to take a system without a controller it would simply have an input and an output . as there is no way to track the output relative to the input then the system is practically useless . if we add a controller , by feeding the output through the controller back to the input the output can be manipulated to meet the desired criteria . for example , if a kettle did not have a controller and it were switched on it would continue to boil the water indefinitely . by adding a controller , the boiling water ( reference ) is fed back to the input through the controller . the controller then tells the input to turn off the power as the water is already boiling . the system without the controller is called the open-loop system . when you add a controller in a feedback loop you create a closed-loop system . open-loop systems are rarely ever consider stable as they can not be controlled . closed-loop systems incorporate a controller or series of controllers which , depending on the current output , configure the input such that the output will have the desired response .
