Electronic component     an electronic component is a basic electronic element . these components can be connected together to make circuits . components can be single items ( resistor , transistor ) or in more or less complex groups as integrated circuits ( logic gate , resistor array ) . a thin metal conductor a flexible conducting electrical or optical link . - cable connector : connector at either end of a cable . - cable matcher : an impedance matching device that allows non-standard cable to be used with a particular device . - cable plant = all the cables , connectors and patch panels within a building or office . - cabling = cable as a material . - co-axial cable = such cables are usually made of a conducting wire . then there is some insulation , then there is another layer of conducting material . finally there is the ( insulating ) mantle . such cables are used as a high-frequency transmission line to carry a high-frequency or broadband signal . because the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists ( ideally ) only in the space between the inner and outer conductors , it can not interfere with or suffer interference from external electromagnetic fields .
