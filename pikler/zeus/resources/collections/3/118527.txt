Die Entführung aus dem Serail     the german libretto is by christoph friedrich bretzner and was changed a bit , without bretzner ’ s permission , by gottlieb stephanie . the story is about the hero belmonte , helped by his servant pedrillo , who tries to rescue his beloved konstanze from the seraglio ( palace ) of the pasha selim . the opera was first performed by the `` nationalsingspiel '' ( `` national singspiel '' ) which was sponsored by the austrian emperor joseph ii . mozart arrived in vienna in 1781 and was looking for an opportunity to get a commission for an opera . he showed one his operas ( `` zaide '' ) to the manager of the nationalsingspiel . he was impressed and asked mozart to write an opera for the company . the work is lighthearted and meant to be funny . some of the characters in the story are turkish . turkish stories and music were very popular at that time in europe , and mozart writes some turkish music ( or what europeans thought was turkish music ) in this opera . some of the arias are very difficult to sing , especially the long `` martern aller arten '' ( `` tortures of all kinds '' ) sung by konstanze , which is like a concerto movement . she is accompanied in this aria by an orchestra and four solo instruments .
