Parallel port     the parallel port ( also known as a printer port or centronics port ) is a type of interface found on computers for connecting various peripherals . a parallel port is a type of interface found on computers ( personal and otherwise ) for connecting peripherals . in computing , a parallel port is a parallel communication physical interface . it was a de facto industry standard for many years , and was finally standardized as ieee 1284 in the late 1990s , which defined a bi-directional version of the port . today , the parallel port interface is seeing decreasing use because of the rise of universal serial bus ( usb ) and firewire ( ieee 1394 ) devices , along with network printing using ethernet . the parallel port interface was originally known as the parallel printer adapter on ibm pc-compatible computers . it was primarily designed to operate a line printer that used ibm 's 8-bit extended ascii character set to print text , but could also be used to adapt other peripherals . graphical printers , along with a host of other devices , have been designed to communicate with the system .
