Pound sterling     the pound sterling ( gbp ; £ or ₤ ) is the official currency used in the united kingdom . it is also used in british overseas territories , isle of man , bailiwicks of guernsey and jersey . the pound is divided into 100 . today 's coins are 1 penny , 2 pence , 5 pence , 10 pence , 20 pence , 50 pence , £1 and £2 . the notes are £5 , £10 , £20 and £50 . a pound coin originally weighed one troy pound of sterling silver , giving the currency the name `` pound sterling '' . `` sterling silver '' means mixed metal that has 92.5 % or more real silver . one pound sterling was originally divided by 240 sterling pence . this was because there are 240 pennyweights in a troy pound . so a single one–pound coin weighed one troy pound and a single 1–penny coin weighed one pennyweight . the latin word for `` pound '' is `` libra '' . the £ or ₤ is a stylised writing of the letter l , a short way of writing `` libra '' . this is similar to how a pound of mass is abbreviated `` lb '' . up until around the 1970s , especially on typewriters or keyboards without a `` £ '' symbol , it was common to write `` l '' instead of `` £ '' .
