Allele     an allele is a form of a gene at a particular position ( locus ) on a chromosome . it is the bit of coding dna at that place . typical plants and animals have two sets of chromosomes , one set inherited from each parent . these organisms are called diploid . since such organisms have two sets of chromosomes , they have ( except on the sex chromosomes ) two alleles at each gene locus . if the two alleles are identical , the individual is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous . if instead the two alleles are different , the individual is a heterozygote and is heterozygous . in a heterozygote the effect of one allele may completely ‘ mask ’ the other . that is , the phenotype produced by the two alleles in heterozygous combination is identical to that produced by one of the two homozygous genotypes . the allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter , and the alternative allele is said to be recessive to the former . this idea originates in the work of gregor mendel , the founder of genetics .
