Aperture     in optics ( and also photography ) an aperture is a hole where light can pass through . the aperture of a photographic lens is a hole that can be adjusted to different sizes , using the aperture ring . this ring is behind the lens , but in front of the shutter . the aperture ring is a flat circle with a small hole in the centre . the small hole is called the `` aperture '' . the size of the aperture can be changed . when the aperture is very small only a small amount of light can enter the camera . when the aperture is big , a lot of light can get in . this lets the photographer control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor . the aperture is changed along with the shutter speed to control the amount of light that enters the camera . this amount of light is called the exposure . typically , a fast shutter speed will not let much light in ( meaning the picture could come out too dark ) , so the photographer will use a larger aperture to correct for this . a slow shutter speed will need a smaller aperture to stop the picture coming out too bright .
