Camogie     camogie ( in irish , `` camógaíocht '' ) is an irish team sport , organised by the `` camogie association of ireland '' , the women 's variant of hurling . the rules are almost identical to hurling with a few exceptions . one is that goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players and a player in camogie can handpass a score , which is not allowed in the men 's game . all games last 60 minutes ( senior inter-county hurling games last 70 ) , and dropping the camogie stick to handpass the ball is allowed . the all-ireland final is held every year in croke park during september , usually the week between the hurling final and gaelic football final . there are two main competitions ; the national league which is staged during the winter-spring months and is used as a warm-up to the all-ireland championships during the summer . the reigning champions are wexford . camogie/hurling is unique in that it uses a different name for the version played by men and women . the reason is complicated : men play using a curved stick called in irish a `` camán '' . women would use a shorter stick , called by the diminutive form `` camóg '' . the suffix - '' aíocht '' was added to both words to give names for the sports : `` camánaíocht '' ( which became `` iománaíocht '' ) and `` camógaíocht '' . when the gaelic athletic association was founded in 1884 the english-origin name `` hurling '' was given to the men 's game . when an organisation for women was set up in 1904 , it was decided to anglicise the irish name `` camógaíocht '' to `` camogie '' .
