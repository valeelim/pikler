Transistor–transistor logic     transistor–transistor logic ( ttl ) is a class of digital circuits built from transistors and resistors . it is called `` transistor–transistor logic '' because the logic function ( e.g. , and ) and amplification is performed by transistors . many integrated circuits have ttl technology . they are used in applications such as computers , industrial controls , test equipment and instrumentation , synthesizers , etc . series type . - bipolar - 74 - the `` standard ttl '' logic family ( long obsolete ) had no letters between the `` 74 '' and the specific part number . - 74l - low power ( compared to the original ttl logic family ) , very slow ( rendered obsolete by the ls-series ) - h - high speed ( rendered obsolete by the s-series , used in 1970s era computers ) - s - schottky ( obsolete ) - ls - low power schottky - as - advanced schottky - als - advanced low power schottky - f - fast ( faster than normal schottky , similar to as ) - cmos - c - cmos 4-15v operation similar to 4000 series - hc - high speed cmos , similar performance to ls , 12ns
