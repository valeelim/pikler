Complex system     a complex system is one where smaller elements make complex things happen . these smaller elements can be simple elements or they can be complex systems within themselves . any such complex elements can be interrelated in simple or complex ways and may be hard to identify as distinct . 'complex systems ' is a field which studies the common properties of systems considered complex in nature , society and science . it is also called `` complex systems theory '' , `` complexity science '' , `` study of complex systems '' and/or `` sciences of complexity '' . the key problems of such systems are difficulties with their formal modeling and simulation . from such perspective , in different research contexts complex systems are defined on the base of their different attributes .
