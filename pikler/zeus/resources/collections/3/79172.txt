Catalytic converter     a catalytic converter is a device in the exhaust pipe of a car , near its engine . it is used to clean up the exhaust the car sends out into the atmosphere . it works by using a catalyst material , usually made of platinum , palladium , and rhodium . the catalytic converter converts carbon monoxide , hydrocarbons , and nitrogen oxides , all of which make the air dirty and make people sick , into carbon dioxide , water , and nitrogen , all of which are less harmful . these chemicals , however , are still large contributors to global warming . a catalytic converter reduces carbon monoxide by contacting it with oxygen , creating carbon dioxide , which is less harmful . because hydrocarbons are unburned fuel particles that are put into the catalytic converter , they burn up in the catalytic converter , making it very hot .
