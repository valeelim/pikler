Source code     in computer programming , source code is ( generally speaking ) a text file version of a computer program or software that contains instructions that the computer follows to do something . source code is written in a programming language which a human can read and change . a large program may contain many different source code files that all work together . these days most source code is compiled when it is finished . this translates the code into assembly language or machine language which is much faster and easier for the computer to read , but hard for a human to read . a computer program may be open source , which means the source code is shared with anyone who wants to look at it and change it , or closed source , which means only the people who made the program can look at and change the code . when compiled by a c compiler and executed , this will print `` hello world ! '' on the computer screen and then finish .
