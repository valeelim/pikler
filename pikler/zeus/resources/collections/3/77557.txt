Electric potential     difference in electric potential is also known as voltage or electric potential energy difference . the unit for electric potential is the volt , in memory of alessandro volta . electric potential is like a push . electrons are pushed through a wire by the voltage . a good analogy is water in a river . the water is like electrons flowing . when the river goes over a waterfall , the water drops and loses energy . when the electrons go through a circuit or wire they `` drop '' in voltage and lose energy . there are positive ions on one side and negative ions on the other side . the negative ones are attracted to the positive ones but can not get to them because there is a wall between them in the battery . so you make them go 'around the house and through the back door ' i.e . you make a circuit which goes from the negative side to the positive side . then the negative ions go through the wire and mix with the positive ones . when all the negative ones go to the other side the battery is flat and needs to be recharged . think of a turbine in water . water passes through it moving down and turns it . when the negative ions move through the wire they go through things like bulbs , microwaves etc . instead of moving them , they collide into them , but only some go through . when they collide they produce light and heat . the reason why we have electrical appliances today is because these negative ions collide into the positive ions in a circuit .
