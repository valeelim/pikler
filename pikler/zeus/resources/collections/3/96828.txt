Appanage     appanage is important to the history of france during the middle ages . the law said that when a king dies , his oldest son becomes the next king . kings who wanted to give a younger son some land too sometimes created an appanage . appanage was one way to keep a civil war from happening , if two or more sons wanted to fight each other to be the next king . the younger son controlled the appanage as a duke and ruled almost like a king , except he could not sell the land . the ruler of an appanage could give it to his sons and grandsons , but eventually that part of the family would run out of sons and the land would go back to the king .
