Sea lion     sea lions are several pinnipeds from the family otariidae ( eared seals ) . they live all around the world , except in the atlantic ocean . male sea lions have thick fur around the face and neck , which sometimes looks like a lion 's mane . that 's how they got the name `` sea lion '' . some , like the steller sea lion , can actually roar ! of course , these pinnipeds are not really lions at all , but they are mammals . like lions , they have fur , breathe air , give birth to live young , and feed milk to their young . they also eat meat , though sea lions eat the meat of fishes , squids , and sea birds instead of land animals . sea lions are also fierce fighters , just like lions . the pinniped species called `` sea lion '' are : - steller sea lion or northern sea lion ( `` eumetopias jubatus '' ) - australian sea lion ( `` neophoca cinerea '' ) - south american sea lion or southern sea ion ( `` otaria flavescens '' ) - new zealand sea lion ( `` phocarctos hookeri '' ) - california sea lion ( `` zalophus californianus '' )
