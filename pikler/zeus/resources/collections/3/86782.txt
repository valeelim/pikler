Accommodation (eye)    accommodation ( eye ) accommodation is the way the eye increases optical power ( the degree to which the lens converges or diverges light ) . this is necessary to produce a clear image ( focus ) on an object when it draws near the eye . a lens that is more convex ( fatter in the middle ) would refract more light rays than a less convex lens ( thinner lens ) . the lens can change shape because the cells of the lens contain an elastic crystalline protein . the young human eye can change focus from distance to seven centimeters from the eye in 350 milliseconds . the eye focuses on a given object by changing the shape of the eye lens through accommodation . this is controlled by ciliary muscle , which is attached to the lens . other websites . - pupileyes - learn about accommodation of the eye
