Argus As 014     the argus as 014 was a pulse jet engine used on the german v-1 flying bomber of world war ii . this was meant to be a simple model that would have been easy to make a lot of for not very much money . the engine was made from a sheet of steel that was rolled into a tube . a shutter was placed at one of the ends of the tube , along with a fuel valve and an igniter ( something that lights things on fire ) . it was thought that this could become a good power source for some last ditch german fighters during the last few days of world war ii .
