Electrocution     electrocution or electric shock is when electricity passes through something living . it happens when the human body gets in contact with electric current . the word `` electrocution '' originated as a portmanteau between electricity and execution , referring to those executed by electric chair , but has evolved to describe any fatal encounter with electricity . nonfatal encounters are called electric shocks , or simply a `` shock '' . the human body is well suited to withstand voltage , but not very much electric current ( measured in amperes ) . if the electric current is strong , it can stop heartbeat and cause death . very high voltage and/or current can cause severe burns and even fry the victim alive .
