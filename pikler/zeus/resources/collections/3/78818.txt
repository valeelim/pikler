Greywacke     greywacke is a type of sandstone . it is hard , and dark in color . it has different sized grains of quartz , feldspar , and small rock fragments set in a compact , fine clay matrix . it is mostly found in palaeozoic strata . the larger grains can be sand-to-gravel-sized , and matrix materials make up more than 15 % of the rock by volume . the origin of greywacke was a problem . gravel , sand and mud should not be laid down together , because river outflow drops heavier grains first . now geologists think greywacke is formed by submarine avalanches or strong turbidity currents . these actions churn sediment and cause mixed-sediment slurries to occur . when this happens , the resulting rocks show various sedimentary features . support for the turbidity current origin is the fact that deposits of greywacke are found on the edges of the continental shelves , at the bottoms of oceanic trenches , and at the bases of mountain formational areas . it also occurs in association with black shales of deep sea origin .
