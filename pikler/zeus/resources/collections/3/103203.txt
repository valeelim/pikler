Sola fide     sola fide means `` faith only '' . most protestants believe that people must trust jesus . they have to trust that jesus brings people back into relationship with god . christians believe that sin creates a gap between people and god , and jesus , who was perfect , died , taking the punishment for sin in place of people , bridging the gap . this is called salvation because jesus 'saves ' people from a life and afterlife without god . the idea of `` sola fide '' means that trust in jesus is the only way to get salvation and finally get into heaven after death . this belief in faith as the only way to be saved was a principle of the protestant reformation of the reformer of the catholic church martin luther and is a principle of protestants today ( see five solas ) . some groups like the catholic and eastern orthodox christians believe jesus died to bridge the gap between god and people , but they must also try to be good people in order to get salvation . protestants also believe that christians need to do what is right , but their salvation only depends on their faith .
