Antagonist     an antagonist is the character in a story who has evil intent . the antagonist ( s ) is the opposing character to a protagonist , which are the characters that have good intent . antagonists normally have reasoning for committing acts of evil . though it is rare , it is possible for an antagonist to be an evil doer committing acts of which a protagonist might through acts which may seem evil , which throw off most readers and characters of a story . as an example , in the disney movie `` the lion king '' , the main antagonist is scar . a secondary antagonist is an evil doer who serves to a main antagonist , or a character who is a minor enemy of the protagonist . this does not , however , mean that this character is necessarily evil , just annoying or against the hero or heroine . it is possible for a protagonist to become an antagonist . a well-known example of this is in the `` star wars '' movie series , when anakin skywalker turns from a jedi to a sith , to become darth vader .
