Power cut     a power cut , sometimes called a power outage or blackout , is a word for when the electric power does not work in an area . it is sometimes caused by a power line ( or electricity cable ) falling down , but may also happen due to routine maintenance . in poor countries , such as many in africa , there are regular power cuts as more people try to use the electricity than there is to go around .
