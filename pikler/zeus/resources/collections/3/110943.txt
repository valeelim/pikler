Mixosaurus     mixosaurus was a small , common and cosmopolitan triassic ichthyosaur . it was only about a meter in length . fossils are known from alaska , canada , china , timor , indonesia , italy , nevada , new zealand , spitsbergen , and svalbard . thus it lived in the tethys sea but also ventured further afield . `` mixosaurus '' seems to have been a transitional form between the more primitive eel-shaped icthyosaurs such as `` cymbospondylus '' and the more advanced shatsasaurs and euichthyosaurs ( the latter including the familiar dolphin- or porpoise-shaped icthyosaurs ) .
