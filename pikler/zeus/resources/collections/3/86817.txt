List of readability tests     this is a list of formulas which predict textual difficulty . these are ways of predicting how hard a piece of writing will be to understand ( its textual difficulty ) . research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read . 1. how difficult the words are : this is `` lexical '' difficulty . rare words are less well known than common words . rare , difficult words are often longer than common , easy words . 1. how difficult the sentences are : this is `` syntactical '' difficulty . long , complicated sentences cause more difficulty than short , simple sentences . formulae for predicting how difficult a sample of prose will be for readers are called `` readability formulae '' . some measure only the difficulty of the vocabulary : they are one-variable measures . others include a measure of syntax such as sentence length . validity of formulae can be judged by comparing them to each other , which is a kind of consistency check . more important is a check for how well they predict an independent ( `` outside '' ) criterion of readability .
