Silent trade     silent trade , or barter , is when traders ( who do not speak each other 's language ) trade without talking to each other . this was used in many parts of ancient africa . silent bartering was used during 500 a.d to 1500 a.d. and probably had a much longer history . to do a silent barter , one group of traders would go to a certain place , leaving whatever they are offering to trade . the other group of traders would then decide if they would like to accept the goods ( usually salt or gold ) that were left . if the goods met with approval , the second group would then take the goods , leave their own goods in return , and leave because the person accepted the offer . this system of trading was used mostly in ancient ghana . the popular things they sold were gold and salt . another system was face-to-face trading using hand signals . gold mined south of the sahel was traded , pound for pound , for salt mined in the desert . the salt from the desert was needed by the people of sahel to flavor and preserve their food and gold has always had value for adornment ( wearing ) . because of this trade , cities grew and flourished and parts of west africa became commercial centers . west africa produced gold until about 1500 ad .
