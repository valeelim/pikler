Weighing scale     scales are used to measure the weight of an item . to use a scale , the item which needs to be weighed is put on one side of the scale . then , weigh stones are put on the other side . once the scale balances ( that is the indicator between the two scales is in the middle ) , the correct weight was chosen . there are also modern scales , where the item is simply put on the scale . its weight can then be read from an electronic or analogue display . weighting scales are used to measure the weight of an item . to use a scale , the item which needs to be weighed is put on one side of the scale . then , usually stones are put on the other side to compare the weight of the stone with the weight of the object you have chosen . if both cups are in the middle , it means that the weights of the objects are equal . if one cup is more up while the other one is down , it means that the one that is down is the heavier one . for example : if you place a small stone in one cup , and a watch in the other cup , and the cup with the watch goes down and the stone obviously goes up , it means that the watch has a greater weight than the stone .
