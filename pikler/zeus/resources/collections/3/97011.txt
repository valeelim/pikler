Seikan Tunnel     seikan tunnel（ja : 青函トンネル）is a railway tunnel in japan . it connects hokkaido to aomori prefecture . this tunnel is the second longest transport tunnel in the world . the tunnel is 53.85 km ( 33.49 miles ) long . 23.3 km ( 14.5 mile ) of the tunnel is underwater . there are two stations in the tunnel . the means of transportation from hokkaido to honshu was seikan ship until seikan tunnel was completed . it took about 3 hours . however , it had some troubles . for example , the sea route was n't safe . toyamaru accident in 1954 had 1155 dead and missing person , caused by typhoon number 15 roke . because of that reason , the plan that constructing seikan tunnel from hokkaido to honshu was becoming a reality . at first , east route and west route was considered . in west route , the deepest depth of water was 140 meter and the nature of the soil was easy to drill rocks , so west route was chosen . we can go through the tunnel by the bullet train . inner structure of the tunnel was planed to make 3 bullet train 's rails . because half of this tunnel located under the bottom of the sea , workers who built this tunnel worried about seawater . so , they used new construction techniques . for example , laser measurement , 2150m horizontal drilling , pouring water glass and cement into soft bedrock . these techniques was paid attention by all of the world at that time . there are still much water , so the seawater is collected place in the tunnel and is pumped out of the tunnel .
