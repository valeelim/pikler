Normal lens     in photography the word normal lens is used for camera lenses that have a focal length which is roughly the diagonal of the image projected inside the camera . camera lenses with a shorter focal length are called `` wide-angle lenses '' , those with a longer one `` telephoto lenses '' . this gives a `` natural perspective '' . - in digital photography the situation is more complex . the sensor type diameter is not the sensor diameter : - in cinematography a focal length roughly equivalent to twice the diagonal of the image projected within the camera is considered normal .
