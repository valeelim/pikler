Sarabande     a sarabande ( spelt sarabanda in italian ) , is a dance that was popular in baroque music in the 17th and early 18th centuries . composers of the baroque period often composed a group of several dances . this was called a suite . there was usually an allemande , a courante , a sarabande and a gigue , in that order , and sometimes one or two other dances or as well . the sarabande was a slow dance with 3 beats in a bar ( 3/4 time ) . there was always a small stress on the second beat of the bar . the note on the first beat would often be played quite short so that the second beat would feel heavy . like the other dance movements in the suite , the sarabande was in binary form . the sarabande seems to have come from central america where it was known as `` zarabanda '' . although it was mainly used in the baroque period , composers in the 20th century such as debussy , satie , howells and britten sometimes wrote sarabandes . perhaps the most famous sarabande is one written by an unknown composer . the piece is called `` la folie espagnole '' . many baroque composers such as monteverdi and corelli and even some modern ones used this well-known tune .
