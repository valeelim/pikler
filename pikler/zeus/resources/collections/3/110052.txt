Dromaeosaur     dromaeosaurs are family of bird-like theropod dinosaurs , which included the famous `` velociraptor '' . they were small to medium-sized feathered carnivores which flourished in the cretaceous period . they are often called raptors , a term popularized by the movie `` jurassic park '' . they were fast-running predators . dromaeosaurs had a world-wide distribution . they first appeared in the middle jurassic , 167 million years ago ( mya ) . the larger types are not found before about 124 mya in the lower cretaceous , and are only found in the northern hemisphere . they survived until the end of the cretaceous , 65.5 mya at the k/t extinction event . the presence of dromaeosaurs in the middle jurassic is shown by isolated fossil teeth , though no dromaeosaurid body fossils have been found this early . the dromaeosaur skeleton suggests they were active , fast-running , and closely related to birds . dromaeosaurs have a relatively large skull , serrated teeth , narrow snout , and forward-facing eyes with some degree of binocular vision .
