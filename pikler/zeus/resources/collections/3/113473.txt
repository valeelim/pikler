Crystal radio     a crystal radio , sometimes called a crystal set , is a very simple am radio receiver , that does not need batteries to work . a long wire antenna gathers enough of the radio signals from nearby transmitters to power a crystal diode , which the signals , and plays them as sound through an earphone or small . crystal radios have come and gone many times in history . they were built in the early days of radio broadcasting by amateurs , and people who could not afford a well-made radio . they became popular again during the great depression , when money was scarce . during world war ii , american soldiers built `` radios '' that used a razor blade and pencil point instead of a crystal . ( german and italian troops had equipment to detect normal superheterodyne radio receivers working , so an alternate choice was a wise one . ) after the war ended , amateurs built more crystal sets , and children began to make them as science and hobby projects . later during the vietnam war prisoners of war again built simple radios , and soldiers used slinky springs as antennas .
