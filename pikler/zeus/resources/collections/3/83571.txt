107 Camilla     107 camilla is one of the biggest main belt asteroids . it orbits within the cybele group , beyond most of the main belt asteroids . it has a very dark surface and is made of carbonate . it was found by n. r. pogson on november 17 , 1868 , and named after camilla , queen of the volsci in roman mythology . study of its light curve shows that camilla 's pole probably points towards ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( +51° , 72° ) with a 10° uncertainty , which gives it an axial tilt of 29° . on march 1 , 2001 , a moon of camilla was found by a. storrs , f. vilas , r. landis , e. wells , c. woods , b. zellner , and m. gaffey using the hubble space telescope . it has been labelled s/2001 ( 107 ) 1 but it does not yet have an official name . later sightings in september 2005 with the vlt allowed scientists to work out its orbit . apart from data in infobox , the inclination was found to be 3 ± 1° with respect to an axis pointing towards ( β , λ ) = ( +55° , 75° ) . given the ~10° uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of camilla , the orbit 's inclination probably is less than 10° .
