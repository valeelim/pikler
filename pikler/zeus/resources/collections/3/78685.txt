Circadian rhythm     a circadian rhythm is a rhythm that repeats about every 24 hours . plants and animals have these built-in cycles which allow them to flower at the right time , sleep at the right time etc . the word `` circadian '' comes from the latin `` circa '' , `` around '' , and `` diem '' or `` dies '' , `` day '' , meaning `` about a day . '' the study of biological time-keeping rhythms such as daily , tidal , weekly , seasonal , and annual rhythms , is called chronobiology . circadian rhythms are `` built-in '' so that , without time signals from the environment , they keep time at the rate of `` about '' 24-hour periods . when kept in total darkness , plants and animals continue to behave by the built-in period which is `` about '' 24 hours . the rhythms are also affected and re-set by time signals such as daylight and the length of the day and the night . it is important that the rhythms be re-set regularly to the natural light/dark cycle . adult humans of all ages have a circadian rhythm which averages 24 hours and 11 minutes . the circadian rhythms , also called the `` biological clock '' or the `` body clock '' , of humans and other animals , regulate many bodily functions including feeding , sleeping , body temperature and hormone production .
