Cricket (insect)    cricket ( insect ) crickets , family gryllidae ( also known as `` true crickets '' ) , are insects somewhat related to grasshoppers and more closely related to katydids or bush crickets ( family tettigoniidae ) . they have somewhat flattened bodies and long antennae . there are about 900 species of crickets . they tend to be nocturnal and are often confused with grasshoppers because they have a similar body structure including jumping hind legs . crickets are known for their chirp ( which only male crickets can do ; male wings have ridges or `` teeth '' that act like a `` comb and file '' instrument ) . the left forewing has a thick rib ( a modified vein ) which bears 50 to 300 `` teeth '' . the chirp is made by raising their left forewing to a 45 degree angle and rubbing it against the upper hind edge of the right forewing , which has a thick scraper ( berenbaum 1995 ) . this sound producing action is called `` stridulation '' and the song is species-specific . there are two types of cricket songs : a calling song and a courting song . the calling song attracts females and repels other males , and is fairly loud .
