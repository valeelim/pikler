Ornithopod     ornithopods are the infraorder of bird-hipped dinosaurs . they started out as small , bipedal running grazers , and grew in size and numbers until they became one of the most successful groups of herbivores in the cretaceous world . their major evolutionary advantage was the progressive development of a chewing apparatus that became the most sophisticated ever developed by a reptile . they had beaks , multiple teeth rows , cheek pouches and true chewing . efficient chewing means faster digestion , as the material is broken into smaller pieces . they reached their apex in the duck-bills , before they were wiped out by the cretaceousâ€“tertiary extinction event with all other non-avian dinosaurs . members are known from all seven continents , although the antarctic remains are unnamed , and they are generally rare in the southern hemisphere . they are the sister group to the horned dinosaurs ( ceratopsia ) and the hard-headed dinosaurs ( pachycephalosauria ) . ornithopoda means `` bird feet '' , from the greek . it refers to their three-toed feet ( though many early forms had four toes ) . they had no armour , a horny beak , and various other features . some ornithopods and cerapods had thin cartilaginous plates along the outside of the ribs . in some cases , these plates mineralized and so were fossilized . the function of these plates is unknown .
