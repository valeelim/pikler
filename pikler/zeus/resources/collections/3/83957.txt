Joseph Conrad     joseph conrad ( 3 december 1857 – 3 august 1924 ) ( real name : `` józef teodor konrad korzeniowski '' ) was a polish writer , regarded as one of the greatest english-language novelists . this is very remarkable , because he did not learn to speak english well until he was in his 20s and therefore always had a polish accent . people think conrad 's prose style is one of the best of all english novelists . he also is seen as important for paving the way to modernist literature . his narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many modern writers and inspired such films as `` apocalypse now '' ( after conrad 's `` heart of darkness '' ) . conrad lived in the time of the british empire and worked in the merchant navy . so he had experience enough to write novels and short stories about empire and navy . short stories . - `` the idiots '' ( conrad 's first short story ; written during his honeymoon , published in `` savo '' 1896 and collected in `` tales of unrest '' , 1898 ) . - `` the black mate '' ( written , according to conrad , in 1886 ; published 1908 ; posthumously collected in `` tales of hearsay '' , 1925 ) .
