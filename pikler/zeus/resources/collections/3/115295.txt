Lamarckism     lamarckism ( also called lamarckian evolution ) is a hypothesis regarding evolution . evolution tries to explain how species change over time . today , the only widely accepted theory of evolution is that developed from the ideas of charles darwin . lamarckism was developed by jean-baptiste de lamarck . he based his ideas , to some extent , on those of erasmus darwin , the grandfather of charles darwin . lamarckism says that individuals do not only pass on the things they received from their parents , but also some things they experienced during their lifetime . as an example , he cited giraffes . giraffes , which have long necks , must have evolved from ancestors with much shorter necks . his idea was that adults needed to stretch their neck to reach leaves from high branches . therefore , he thought , the children inherited longer necks . this idea is called `` the inheritance of acquired characteristics '' . although darwin did not entirely break with these ideas , his characteristic idea of natural selection relates to the individuals 's relative survival and success in reproduction . better adapted forms leave , on average , more offspring . this changes the proportion of alleles in the population .
