Larynx     the larynx ( plural `` larynges '' ) , also known as the voice box , is an organ in the neck of humans and animals . it helps to protect the wind pipe by stopping it from inhaling food . it also helps with breathing and making sounds . the larynx houses the vocal cords . sound is created in the larynx . both pitch and loudness are controlled here . it has a small slit through which air passes and when the vocal cords vibrate air is vibrated.this sound is changed as it travels through the vocal tract . it becomes a different sound based on the position of the tongue , lips , mouth , and pharynx . when swallowing , the backward motion of the tongue forces part of the larynx called the epiglottis to cover up the opening to the larynx , also called the laryngeal opening . this is to stop the food swallowed from entering the lungs . the larynx is also pulled upwards to help with this process . if the larynx is irritated by something that is swallowed , a strong cough reflex is used to protect the lungs . there are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly . some symptoms are hoarseness , loss of voice , pain in the throat or ears , and breathing difficulties . larynx transplant is not done very often . the world 's first successful operation took place in 1998 at the cleveland clinic , and the second took place in october 2010 at the university of california medical center in sacramento .
