Checkpoint Charlie     checkpoint charlie was one of three places where people could travel from the western occupied sectors of germany and berlin to the soviet occupied sectors . these places were called checkpoints because they were places where passports and identities were checked . - `` checkpoint alpha '' was at helmstedt in west germany , in the former british zone . it was at the western end of the main road ( autobahn ) to west berlin . - `` checkpoint bravo '' was at dreilinden at the west berlin end of that autobahn . - `` checkpoint charlie '' was at friedrichstraße in west berlin . it was the most famous . it was the only place where foreigners could walk or drive from west berlin into east berlin . as it was the only crossing point there were sometimes queues of people waiting to cross . but military traffic was never stopped , because berlin was supposed to be under the control of all four wartime allies . after the end of the cold war , and the reunification of germany the checkpoints were no longer needed . the big concrete buildings of checkpoint bravo are now used by the german customs service . checkpoint charlie was only a wooden hut in the street . it was moved to what is now the allied museum at 110 clayallee , and a small replica put up in kochstraße . the fake checkpoint is very popular with tourists who have their photographs taken in front of it .
