Outflow (meteorology)    outflow ( meteorology ) outflow is a term for the air that flows away from a thunderstorm . lots of outflow show that a storm is `` healthy '' . the `` edge '' of the outflow boundary can often be detected by weather radar . convergence occurs along the leading edge of the downdraft . convergence of dust , aerosols , and bugs at the leading edge will lead to a higher clear air signature . the signature of the leading edge is also influenced by the density change between the cold air from the downdraft and the warm environmental air . this density boundary will increase the number of echo returns from the leading edge . clouds , hydrometeors and new thunderstorms can also develop along the outflow 's leading edge . this makes it possible to locate the outflow boundary when using precipitation mode . the image to the right depicts a particularly strong ouflow boundary ahead of a line of storms . often , the outflow boundary will bow in the direction it is moving the quickest .
