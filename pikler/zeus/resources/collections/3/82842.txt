Combinatorics     combinatorics is a branch of mathematics . it is concerned with finite or countable infinite sets . combinatorics is part of discrete mathematics . combinatorics are about graph theory , or partitions of sets . according to george p√≥lya , combinatorics looks at counting the number of possibilities , and about the questions whether certain configurations exist , and how to get to them . permutation is concerned with the following problems : - determining how many different ways there are to arrange a number of objects . - determining how many ways there are to select a number of objects from a larger set . there are variations in the problems as follows : - the objects may or may not be distinguishable . - the order in which the objects are selected may or may not matter . examples . - there are 6 different ways to arrange three distinguishable objects ( as shown in the graphic ) . - there are three different ways to select one particular orange from a basket with three oranges . - there is only one possible way to select the apple from a basket that has one orange , one apple and one pear in it .
