Sauropod     sauropoda are an infraorder of saurischian ( `` lizard-hipped '' ) dinosaurs . they had very long necks , long tails , small heads ( in comparison to the rest of their body ) , and thick , pillar-like legs and peg-like teeth . they are notable for the enormous sizes of some species . the group includes the largest animals ever to have lived on land . well-known genera include `` brachiosaurus '' , `` diplodocus '' , `` apatosaurus '' and `` brontosaurus '' . sauropods first appeared in the upper triassic period . their probable ancestral group was the prosauropoda . by the upper jurassic ( 150 million years ago ) , sauropods had become widespread ( especially the diplodocids and brachiosaurids ) . by the upper cretaceous , those groups had mainly been replaced by the titanosaurs , which had a near-global distribution . they were larger relatives of the brachiopods . as with all other non-avian dinosaurs , the titanosaurs died out in the cretaceousâ€“paleogene extinction event . fossilised remains of sauropods have been found on every continent , including antarctica .
