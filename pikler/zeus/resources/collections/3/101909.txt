Protostome     protostomes are a nephrozoan taxon of animals above the level of phylum . it is not part of the normal system of classification . they are a subtaxon of the bilateria , and are contrasted with the deuterostomes . protosomes are distingued by their embryo : in deuterostomes , the first opening ( the blastopore ) becomes the anus , while in protostomes it becomes the mouth . dna sequence analysis suggests that protostome animals can be divided into three major groups : - ecdysozoa , e.g . arthropods , nematodes - platyzoa , e.g . platyhelminthes , rotifers - lophotrochozoa , e.g . molluscs , annelids as well as a number of minor taxa , like the chaetognatha .
