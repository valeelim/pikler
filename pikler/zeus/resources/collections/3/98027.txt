Bathymetry     bathymetry is the study of the underwater terrain of lakes or ocean floors . it is the same as topography , except that it looks at the underwater topography . it is a field of oceanography . the name comes from greek ( `` bathus '' ) , meaning `` deep '' , and ( `` metron '' ) , meaning `` measure '' . bathymetric ( or hydrographic ) charts are often made to support the safety of underwater navigation and exploration . most of these underwater topographic maps use contour lines ( called `` depth contours '' or `` isobaths '' ) to show the terrain of the sea floor , and how deep it is . they usually also give surface navigational information . originally , bathymetry involved the measurement of ocean depth through sounding . early techniques used heavy rope or cable lowered over a ship 's side . this method measures the depth of the water at a single location each time . it was not a very accurate method . the data used to make bathymetric maps today usually comes from an echosounder ( sonar ) . this device is attached to the bottom or the side of a boat .
