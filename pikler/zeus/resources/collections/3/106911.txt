Wired Equivalent Privacy     wired equivalent privacy ( also known as wep ) is a standard to use encryption in wireless lans . it was introduced in 1999. in 2001 , mathematicians showed that wep is not very strong . a wep connection could be decoded , with software that can be easily found , within minutes . because of this finding , ieee created a new 802.11i group to fix the problems . by 2003 , the wi-fi alliance announced that wi-fi protected access ( wpa ) would replace wep , which was a subset of then upcoming 802.11i amendment . finally in 2004 , they made it official and said that it would go ahead . it was part of the full 802.11i standard ( also known as wpa2 ) , the ieee declared that both wep-40 and wep-104 are not recommended because they are not secure enough . even though it only offers low security , wep is still widely in use . wep is often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools even . today , wep provides a level of security that deters only accidental use . as a result , people can invade and enter the network .
