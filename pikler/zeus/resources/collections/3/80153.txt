Wear (erosion)    wear ( erosion ) in materials science , wear is the erosion of material from a solid surface by the action of another solid . the study of the processes of wear is part of the discipline of tribology . there are four principal wear processes : 1. adhesive wear 1. abrasive wear 1. corrosive wear 1. surface fatigue the definition of wear does not include loss of dimension from plastic deformation , although wear can happen without loss of material . also this definition does not include impact wear where there is no sliding motion or cavitation ( also corrosion ) where counterbody is a fluid.. wear , along with other aging processes such as fatigue , creep , and fracture toughness , causes progressive degradation of materials with time leading to failure of material at an advanced age . under normal circumstances , the property changes during usage normally occur in three different stages as follows : - • primary or early stage or run-in period , where rate of changes can be high . • secondary or mid-age process where a steady rate of aging process is maintained . the useful or working life is at this stage .
