Australopithecus     australopithecus is a genus of extinct hominids closely related to humans . the first `` australopithecus '' described was the taung child , discovered by raymond dart , and described in 1925. their remains are mostly found in east africa , and the first fossil is from 3.9 million years ago ( mya ) . the split from other apes would have taken place earlier , perhaps about 5 mya . it is widely believed that the group of which they are part gave rise to the genus `` homo '' , and hence to human beings . the genus `` australopithecus '' originally included two rather different forms . one form was lightweight : the gracile australopithecines . the other form was bulkier , the robust australopithecines . it is still under discussion whether they should be put in separate genera . here we treat the gracile forms ; the robust forms are described elsewhere as `` paranthropus '' . gracile australopithecines shared several traits with modern apes and humans . they were widespread throughout eastern and northern africa 3.9 to 3 million years ago .
