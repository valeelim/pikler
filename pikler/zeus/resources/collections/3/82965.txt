45 Eugenia     45 eugenia is a big main belt asteroid . it is famous because it is one of the first asteroids to be found to have a moon orbiting it . it is also the second known triple asteroid , after 87 sylvia . eugenia was found in 1857 by hermann goldschmidt . it was named after empress eugenia di montijo , the wife of napoleon iii , and was the first asteroid to be named after a real person , rather than a figure from classical legend ( although there had been controversy about whether 12 victoria was really named for the mythological figure or for queen victoria ) . eugenia is a big asteroid , with a diameter of 214 km . it is an f-type asteroid , which means that it is very dark in colouring ( darker than soot ) made up of carbonate . like mathilde , its density appears to be unusually low , indicating that it may be a loosely-packed rubble pile ( an asteroid that has been broken apart by a collision and pulled back together by gravity ) . lightcurve analysis indicates that eugenia 's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( -30° , 124° ) with a 10° uncertainty , which gives it an axial tilt of 117° . eugenia 's rotation is then retrograde .
