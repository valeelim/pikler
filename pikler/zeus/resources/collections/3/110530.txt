Classified advertising     classified advertising is a form of advertising which is particularly common in newspapers , online and other periodicals , e.g . free ads papers or pennysavers . classified advertising basically allows private individuals ( not simply companies or corporate entities ) to solicit sales for products and services . classified advertising is called such because it is generally grouped within the publication under headings classifying the product or service being offered ( headings such as accounting , automobiles , clothing , farm produce , for sale , for rent , etc . ) and is grouped entirely in a distinct section of the periodical , which makes it distinct from display advertising , which often contains graphics or other art work and which is placed near to editorial content . newspapers have continued their downward trend in classifieds revenue as internet classifieds grow . classified advertising at some of the larger newspaper chains has dropped 14 % to 20 % in 2007 while traffic to classified sites has grown 23 % .
