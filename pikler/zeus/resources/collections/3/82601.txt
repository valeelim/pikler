22 Kalliope     22 kalliope is a big main belt asteroid of the m-type , found by j. r. hind on november 16 , 1852. it is named after calliope , the greek muse of epic poetry . kalliope is somewhat stretched , approximately 180 km in diameter , and slightly asymmetric , as evidenced by resolved images taken with the vlt at the european southern observatory while its spectrum is an m-type , kalliope does not appear to be metallic , similarly to other m-types such as 21 lutetia , for example . firstly , its density , which is known with confidence from its moon 's orbit , is far too low to agree with any plausible metallic substance . furthermore , spectroscopic studies have shown evidence of hydrated minerals and silicates , which indicate that the surface is stony . kalliope also has a low radar albedo , which is again inconsistent with a metallic surface . lightcurve analysis indicates that kalliope 's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( -23° , 20° ) with a 10° uncertainty , which gives kalliope an axial tilt of 103° . kalliope 's rotation is then a bit retrograde .
