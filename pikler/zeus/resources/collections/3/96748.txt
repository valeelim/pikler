Electronvolt     the electron-volt or electron volt , symbol ev , is used to measure energy . it is defined as the amount of energy an electron gains after being accelerated by 1 volt of electricity . joules are used often for energy measurement , but it is sometimes useful to use electron-volts for very small amounts of energy . to convert joules into electron-volts , divide joules by the charge of an electron , which is about 1.602 e.g . 5 j = 5/1.602 5 j = 3.125 ev . the electronvolt is often used in atomic , nuclear and particle physics . for example , the energy of photons can be measured by the voltage necessary to overcome their photoelectric effect . other websites . - conversion tool - electronvolt citizendium
