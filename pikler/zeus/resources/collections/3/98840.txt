Battle of Verdun     the battle of verdun was a battle of the first world war . it started when german troops attacked french positions , near verdun , on february 21 , 1916. it ended on december 18 of that year . the front line had not changed very much . both sides lost about 337,000 soldiers each , which means about half of them died . many historians see this battle as the bloodiest of world history . never before was industrialisation so visible in war . they also speak about the `` hell of verdun '' or the `` blood pump '' . the battle of verdun is considered the biggest and longest in world history . never before or since has there been such a long battle , involving so many men , fought on such a tiny piece of land . the battle , which lasted from 21 february , 1916 until 19 december 1916 caused over an estimated 700,000 casualties ( dead , wounded and missing ) . the battlefield was not even a square ten kilometres . from a strategic point of view , there can be no justification for these terrible losses . the battle lowered into a matter of prestige for the two nations , and started being fought literally and for the sake of fighting and honor , as said by german high command paul von hindenburg . the fighting in verdun was so cruel that a system of rotation of the french army was designed , to let every division on france to fight on verdun . after the battle the landscape was left as one of the worst battlegrounds on all of france , filled with craters of the artillery , the trenches , the odor left by the dead , etc . in the midst of battle german high command erich von falkenhayn , was relieved from duty and sent to romania to lead a joint austrian , german and bulgarian counter-attack , leaving paul von hindenburg as chief of staff of the german army .
