Berlin Observatory     the berlin observatory ( berliner sternwarte in german ) has its origins in 1700 when gottfried leibniz initiated the `` societät der wissenschaften '' ( brandenburgische science society ) which would later ( 1744 ) become the `` preußischen akademie der wissenschaften '' ( prussian academy of sciences ) . the society had no observatory , but nevertheless had an astronomer , gottfried kirch , who observed from a private observatory in berlin . a first small observatory was furnished in 1711 , financing itself through calendrical computations .
