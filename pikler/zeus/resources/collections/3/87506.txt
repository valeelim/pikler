Satguru     in some eastern religions , a satguru ( or sadguru ) is a person who is considered to have achieved enlightenment , and who can help others to achieve the same . the word means `` true teacher '' in sanskrit ( ) , `` sat '' meaning `` true '' and a guru meaning `` teacher '' . the title means that his students have faith that the guru can be trusted and will lead them to moksha , nirvana or inner peace . it is based on a long line of hindu understandings about the importance of the guru . in the `` guru gita '' , shiva says to parvati : - the body , the senses , the prana , wealth , one â€™ s own relations , the self , wife etc. , all these should be surrendered to the satguru . ( 38 ) - one who cuts asunder , for the disciple , the eight kinds of attachment ( doubts , pity , fear , shyness , censure , position in society , high birth and wealth ) , by the sword of mercy and bestows absolute bliss is called satguru . ( 57 ) - just as the ocean is the king of waters , the param guru ( satguru ) is the king among gurus . ( 179 ) - a param guru is free from attachment , etc . ; peaceful , always contented in himself , independent , and one who considers the status of *brahma and vishnu like a blade of grass . ( 180 )
