Gyrobus     a gyrobus is a special bus which does not use a normal engine . it has a big flywheel of steel or other materials ( weighing about one ton ) rotating at very high speed ( rpm ) . by rotating at such high speed , the flywheel stores large amounts of kinetic energy . this big wheel moves the wheels of the bus . at special stations , electric engines accelerate the flywheel so the bus can still run . there are not many buses of this kind because they are very expensive .
