WWE Championship     the wwe championship is a professional wrestling world championship in wwe . it is the original world title of wwe , and is largely considered the highest-ranking title in wwe . it is widely regarded as the most prestigious championship in professional wrestling with its title bouts attracting millions of world wide viewers . the wwe world championship was introduced in 1963 , with buddy rogers becoming the first world champion on april 29. its introduction is said to have come about because of events in the national wrestling alliance ( nwa ) , a promotion with many branches ( also known as `` territories '' ) in north america and worldwide . in the 1950s , capitol wrestling corporation ( cwc ) was an nwa territory , and by 1963 , cwc executives had a large amount of control over nwa . during this time , buddy rogers held the nwa world heavyweight championship , the world title of the nwa , until lou thesz defeated rogers for the championship on january 24 , 1963. after a dispute over the result , cwc left the nwa and created a new promotion , the world wide wrestling federation ( wwwf ) . this new company then created a backstory for its new title , claiming that the wwwf world heavyweight championship had been spun off from the nwa world championship , and that a tournament had been held in rio de janeiro to crown a new champion . buddy rogers was billed as the winner of this tournament , having defeated antonino rocca in the finals . ( in reality , no such tournament took place . ) affiliated with the nwa once again , the wwwf was renamed to world wrestling federation ( wwf ) in 1979. after wwf broke ties again with the nwa in 1983 , this time for good , the championship became known as the wwf world heavyweight championship and later simply as the wwf ( world ) championship by the 1990s .
