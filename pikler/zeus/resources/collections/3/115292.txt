Social darwinism     social darwinism is a term used for different movements . charles darwin was one of the main discoverers of evolution . evolution is a concept from biology that tries to explain how different life-forms change over time . it basically says that because most children are not exactly like their parents , there is change . some of the children will have different features ( or traits ) . these features will mean that some children are better adapted to the place where they live . they will therefore be better able to have offspring . some of the offspring might also have the trait of their parents . social darwinism theories try to use these ideas from biology for human society . they talk about a `` struggle for survival '' of human societies . during the era of nazi ideologies , the idea of survival of the fittest combined with racism . since the aryan race was better than all the other races , it needed more space to live . this space was to be provided in the east ( where mostly slavs lived ) .
