Device controller     a device controller is a part of a computer system that makes sense of the signals going to , and coming from the cpu . there are many device controllers in a computer system . any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket , and the socket is connected to a device controller . device controllers use binary and digital codes . each device controller has a local buffer and a command register . it communicates with the cpu by interrupts . a device 's controller plays an important role in the operation of that device ; it functions as a bridge between the device and the operating system . i-o devices generally contain two parts . one is mechanical and another is electrical part . this electrical part is known as a device controller and can take the form of a chip on personal computers . the device controller receives the data from a connected device and stores it temporarily in some special purpose registers ( i.e . local buffer ) inside the controller . then it communicates the data with a device driver . for each device controller there is an equivalent device driver which is the standard interface through which the device controller communicates with the operating systems through interrupts . device controller is a hardware whereas device driver is a software .
