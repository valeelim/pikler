Messiah (Handel)    messiah ( handel ) messiah is an oratorio by georg frideric handel . it is handel ’ s most famous work , and in england , the most often performed of any big choral work . the title messiah means “ the anointed one ” and is the name given to jesus christ in the christian teaching . georg frideric handel was born in germany . when he was a young man he came to england and he liked it so much that he soon visited england again and stayed there for the rest of his life , becoming a naturalised englishman says the legend . actually he was composer for the king of hannover , who then became king of england , and handel followed his `` employer '' . the main reason why handel liked england at that time was because the people liked his music and gave him support . at this time handel was known as a composer of operas . for about 20 years handel spent most of his time working on operas : composing them , organising performances and looking for opera singers to sing his works . by the late 1730s , however , people ’ s tastes started to change and opera was not so popular . handel changed to writing oratorios . although it is thought that handel invented the oratorio he in fact did not.oratorio is italian , after the oratory of saint philip neri at rome , where famous musical services were held in the 16th century . handel is just one composer of many who wrote oratorios . his oratorios are based on the english tradition of the masque , which was something between a play and an opera . however , oratorios were about stories from the old testament . instead of ancient gods or roman emperors ( which is what operas were about at that time ) he used dramatic stories from the bible . among many great oratorios that he wrote , `` messiah '' is his most famous one . however , it is different from his other oratorios in some ways .
