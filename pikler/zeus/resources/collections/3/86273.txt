Anti-submarine boom net (Sydney Harbour WWII)    anti-submarine boom net ( sydney harbour wwii ) the anti-submarine boom net was used to stop enemy submarines entering sydney harbour during world war ii . the net went all the way across the harbour from green point , watson 's bay to georges head on the other side . the boom was part of the sydney harbour defences which also included artillery batteries and patrol boats . in january 1942 , the australian defence forces began to build the anti-submarine boom net ; it was finished in august 1942. for more than three years , entry by boats , ships and ferries into sydney harbour was through one of three different gates that were a part of the anti-submarine boom net . on 31 may 1942 , during wwii , three japanese submarines tried to get into the harbour . the first submarine to try and come in was the m27 . lieutenant jahai chuma was the man in charge of this submarine . the m27 followed a sydney ferry through the gate on its way to manly , but it got caught in the western end of the net 's middle section . lieutenant chuma , tried to free his submarine by using a special tool that cuts metal , but this only made things worse . by 8:30pm the watchman for the maritime service board , james cargill , went to see what was happening . he used a boat to row across to where the submarine was stuck . very surprised at finding a japanese submarine , cargill called naval headquarters with his two way radio . at first the navy did not believe that there was a japanese midget submarine caught in the boom net . it took him two hours to get them to believe him .
