Diode     a diode is an electronic component with two electrodes ( connectors ) . it allows electricity to go through it only in one direction . diodes can be used to convert alternating current to direct current ( diode bridge ) . they are often used in power supplies and sometimes to decode amplitude modulation radio signals ( like in a crystal radio ) . light-emitting diodes ( leds ) are a type of diode that produce light . today , the most common diodes are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon or sometimes germanium . the first types of diodes were called fleming valves . they were vacuum tubes . they were inside a glass tube ( much like a light bulb ) . inside the glass bulb there was a small metal wire and a large metal plate . the small metal wire would heat up and emit electricity , which was captured by the plate . the large metal plate was not heated , so electricity could go in one direction through the tube but not in the other direction . fleming valves are not used much anymore because they have been replaced by semiconductor diodes . thomas edison also discovered this property when working on his light bulbs .
