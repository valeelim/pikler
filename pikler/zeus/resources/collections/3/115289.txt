Social responses to the idea of evolution     the idea that all life evolved was hotly debated even before charles darwin published `` on the origin of species '' . even today , some people still talk about the concept of evolution and what it means to them , to their philosophy and their religion . sometimes these people also talk about the social implications of evolution . this debate is mostly about the meaning of evolution to human life , or about human nature , not about how evolution works . some people believe in `` guided evolution '' or `` theistic evolution '' . they say that evolution is real , but it is being guided it some way . there are many different concepts of `` theistic evolution '' . many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution . as darwin found out early on , the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is its implications for human origins . in some countries , especially in the united states , there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who reject it . the debate is mostly about if the ideas in evolution should be taught in schools , and in what way .
