History of the Peloponnesian War     the history of the peloponnesian war tells the story of the peloponnesian war in ancient greece . it was written by thucydides , an athenian general who served in that war . the war was fought between the `` peloponnesian league '' ( led by sparta ) and the `` athenian league '' ( led by athens ) . the war lasted more than 20 years . many historians regard this `` history '' of thucydides as one of the earliest scholarly works of history . thucydides ' `` history '' made a number of contributions to early historiography . many of his principles have become standard methods of history writing today , though others have not . one of thucydides ' major innovations was to use a strict standard of chronology , recording events by year , each year consisting of the summer campaigning season and a less active winter season . as a result , events that span several years are divided up and described in parts of the book that are sometimes quite distant from one another , causing the impression that he is oscillating between the various theatres of conflict . this method contrasts sharply with herodotus ' earlier work `` the histories '' , which jumps around chronologically .
