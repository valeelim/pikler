Triple Entente     the triple entente ( english : `` triple agreement '' ) was the name given to an alliance between the united kingdom , france and the russian empire . the alliance was made after the anglo-russian entente , an agreement between britain and russia in 1907. the alliance was made stronger by agreements made with japan , the united states and spain . in this form , there was a balance of power , which meant that no group was much stronger than any other one , with the `` triple alliance '' of germany , austria-hungary and italy . with the first world war , these ententes were not military agreements - but they later involved the military because of the problems between the triple alliance and the triple entente . that 's why the triple entente became a military alliance . in 1915 , italy left the triple alliance , and from 1916 fought against germany . the russian revolution in october 1917 meant that russia left the alliance , but the military alliance between france and the uk lasted until 1940 , when nazi germany invaded france .
