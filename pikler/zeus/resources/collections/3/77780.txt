Birth defect     birth defects ( or congenital defects ) are defects in a baby at birth , or which develop in the first month of life . there are two main types of congenital defect . the first is caused by genetic abnormalities , which are hereditary . the second is caused by conditions ( such as infectious diseases ) which a baby gets from its mother . sometimes doctors can find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth . they use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests , such as amniocentesis . some gene alleles ( versions of a gene ) can damage the baby . conditions like dwarfism are nearly always genetic in origin . one type , achondroplasia , happens when a child 's bones does not grow correctly . another type is caused by pituitary malfunction , where the pituitary gland , which puts out growth hormones , does not work properly . many genetic disorders are caused by mutations ( or changes ) in gene alleles . mutations can cause development to go wrong , or a simple biochemical deficiency ( the body does not have enough of an important chemical ) . in the case of a chemical deficiency , the problem may be curable . for example , phenylketonuria was a cause of mental retardation . doctors came up with a simple test to find which babies have this condition . they found that if these children got treated and followed a strict diet , they could get enough of the chemical they needed . phenylketonuria now causes few cases of mental retardation .
