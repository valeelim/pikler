Nor'easter     a nor'easter ( also northeaster ) is a big storm along the east coast of the united states . a nor'easter is called that because the winds in a nor'easter come from the northeast , especially in the coastal areas of the northeastern united states and atlantic canada . more specifically , it is a low pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the east coast and whose leading winds in the left forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast . the precipitation pattern is similar to other extratropical storms . nor'easters also can cause coastal flooding , coastal erosion , hurricane force winds , and heavy snow . nor'easters are associated with warm fronts , cold fronts , or occluded fronts . nor'easters can occur at any time of the year but are mostly known for their presence in the winter . nor'easters can be devastating and damaging , especially in the winter months , when most damage and deaths are from the cold . nor'easters bring very cold air down from the arctic . nor'easters thrive on the converging air masses ; that is , the polar cold air mass and the warmer ocean water of the gulf stream . nor'easters will usually develop between 30° n. and 35° n .
