Görlitz     görlitz ( , upper sorbian : | '' zhorjelc '' , , ) is a town in germany on the river lusatian neisse , in the `` bundesland '' ( `` federal state '' ) of saxony , opposite the polish town of zgorzelec . zgorzelec was a part of görlitz until 1945. historically görlitz has belonged at times to the regions of lusatia and silesia . today it is the easternmost city in germany . when nazi germany lost the war , german troops blew up all bridges crossing the lusatian neisse . the redrawing of boundaries in 1945 – in particular the relocation of the german-polish border to the oder-neisse line – divided the town , the right bank becoming part of poland , and named zgorzelec in 1948 , while the main portion became part of the german state of saxony . when the east german states were dissolved in 1952 , görlitz became part of the dresden bezirk ( region ) , but the states were restored upon german reunification in 1990. today görlitz and zgorzelec , two towns on opposite banks of the river , have friendly relations . two bridges have been rebuilt , a bus line connects the german and polish parts of the town , and there is a common urban management , with annual common sessions of both town councils .
