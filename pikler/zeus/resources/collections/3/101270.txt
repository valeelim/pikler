History of North America     the history of north america deals with an area where humans came to live relatively recently , compared to africa , europe , and asia . scientists have different theories as to the origins of the early human population of the continent . the indigenous peoples of north america themselves have many creation stories , that tell that native americans have been present on the land since its creation . before contact with europeans the natives of north america were divided into many different communities , from small bands of a few families to large empires . they lived in several culture areas , which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones of north america and give a good indication of the main occupation of the people who lived there ( e.g . the bison hunters of the great plains , or the farmers of mesoamerica ) . native groups can also be classified by their language family . it is important to note that peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture , nor were they always allies .
