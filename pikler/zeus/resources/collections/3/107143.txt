Spanish conquest of Yucatán     the spanish conquest of yucatán was the campaign undertaken by the spanish `` conquistadores '' against the late postclassic maya states . this part of the conquest and colonization of the americas began in the early 16th century , but it took more time than the similar campaigns against the aztec and inca empires . it was about 170 years later before the last maya stronghold fell , that of the itza capital of tayasal on lake petén itzá , in 1697. but except for the petén region and the guatemalan highlands , the spanish had control over yucatán itself already by 1546. unlike the campaigns against the aztec and inca states , the maya had no single political center . therefore the spanish had to fight city by city to break resistance by the indigenous peoples . in the beginning the `` conquistadores '' were mainly interested to get as much gold and silver as possible . because the maya lands were poor in this respect , they were not very interesting for the spanish at that stage . but when land workers became important for the colonies , the spanish turned to the maya region . that was around the 1520s .
