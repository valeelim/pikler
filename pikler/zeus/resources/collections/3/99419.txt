Printed circuit board     a printed circuit board ( pcb ) is a plastic board made for connecting electronic components together . these are used in almost all computers and electronics today . the `` card '' is made of a material that does not conduct electricity , like fiberglass or plastic . usually copper is etched ( set in thin lines ) inside the board between the layers of plastic , or on the surface of the board . this makes the electricity go only where it is wanted . electronic components are then attached to this board using a metal to conduct electricity . the metal etched into the board allows electricity to travel from one component to another in electrical circuits . boards can have many different parts which are connected and work together . the most common circuit boards are made in large numbers for a specific job , for example to run a computer , a mobile/cell phone or a television . some circuit boards are made plain so a person can build their own for a new electrical task . most things that use electricity have at least one circuit board inside of them that makes them run .
