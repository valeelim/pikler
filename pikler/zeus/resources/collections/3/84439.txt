Ark of the Covenant     the ark of the covenant ( ארון הברית in hebrew : `` aron hab'rit '' ) is described in the bible as a holy container where the ten commandments and other holy israelite objects are held . according to the bible , yahweh commanded the ark be built when moses had a prophetic vision at sinai ( exodus 25:9-10 ) . some people believe the ark contained aaron 's rod , a jar of manna , and the first torah scroll written by moses , based on their reading of book of exodus , book of numbers , and the letter to the hebrews . the first of the books of kings says that during the time of king solomon , the ark held only the ten commandments . the hebrew word `` aron '' is used in the bible to designate any type of ark or chest , for any purpose ( genesis 50:26 ; 2 kings 12:9 , 10 ) . the ark of the covenant is distinguished from all others by such titles as `` ark of god '' ( 1 samuel 3:3 ) , `` ark of the covenant '' ( josh . 3:6 ; hebrews 9:4 ) , `` ark of the testimony '' ( ex . 25:22 ) . the ark ( aron kodesh in hebrew meaning holy cupboard ) is a raised cupboard found in jewish synagogues which contains the holy torah scrolls . these are all written by hand and can take years to make . it is always on the wall of the synagogue which faces towards jerusalem .
