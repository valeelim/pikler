Tautology (rhetoric)    tautology ( rhetoric ) in rhetoric , a tautology is an argument or proposition which is self-proving . the claim as stated is logically irrefutable ( can not be wrong ) . this hides the lack of evidence or valid reasoning supporting the conclusion . in effect , the meaning is repeated , usually in terms which appear to be different . it is not just repetition . basically , it is saying the same thing twice , but you might say it using different words , i.e . you might say `` we are reversing backwards '' . this is tautology because you have already said that you are moving backwards , but it has been repeated , possibly as a mistake or for emphasis . sometimes , the tautology is not easy to see , - because it is part of an acronym ; examples hiv virus ( the `` v '' in `` hiv '' stands for `` virus '' ) , `` raid array '' ( the `` a '' in `` raid '' ) - because languages are different : examples sahara desert ( `` sahara '' means `` desert '' ) more examples . - the tenth amendment to the us constitution : in `` new york v. united states , '' supreme court justice sandra day o'connor stated , `` the tenth amendment likewise limits the power of congress , but this limit is not derived from the text of the tenth amendment itself , which , as we have discussed , is essentially a tautology '' . o'connor reasoned that the tenth amendment repeated what was already in the structure of the constitution . when the states consented to the constitution they expressly delegated certain powers to the federal government . what was not given was necessarily retained by the states .
