809 Lundia     809 lundia is a small , binary , v-type asteroid orbiting in the flora family in the main belt . it is named after lund observatory , sweden . the v-type spectrum says that it is not genetically related to the flora family , but rather is probably a piece ( actually two pieces ) blown off the surface of nearby 4 vesta by a big impact in the past . its orbit is too far from vesta for it to actually be a member of the vesta family it is not clear how it came at an orbit so far from vesta , but other examples of v-type asteroids fairly far from their parent body are known . a mechanism of interplay between the yarkovsky effect and nonlinear secular resonances ( mainly involving jupiter and saturn ) has been suggested . a moon , designated s/2005 ( 809 ) 1 , was seen based on lightcurve sightings in 2005. in fact , the size of the two bodies appear to be close in size , because during mutual occultations the brightness drops by a similar amount independently of which body is hidden . assuming an albedo similar to 4 vesta ( around 0.4 ) , suggests that the bodies are about 7 km across . it takes 15.4 hours to orbit each other , which says that the binary is very close — the separation being of the order of 10–20 km , if normal asteroid albedo and density values are assumed .
