European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages     the european charter for regional or minority languages ( ecrml ) is a european treaty that was adopted in 1992. it was designed by the council of europe to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in europe . it only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the state parties which have a lot of differences from the majority or official language . this means that the treaty does not protect languages used by recent immigrants from other countries . also , the treaty does not protect local dialects of ( ways of speaking ) the official or majority language ) to be protected a language should be spoken either by - the people living in a region or area of the country ; or by - a minority in the country as a whole ( this means languages such as yiddish and romani are covered by the treaty even though there is no `` romani region '' ) . national official languages are not covered by the treaty , but regional official languages can be . for example , catalan is only official within a region of spain , so could benefit from the treaty but irish can not because it is an official language in republic of ireland , even though it is a minority language . however irish is protected in northern ireland because it is not an official or national language of the united kingdom .
