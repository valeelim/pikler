Customs     most countries have a customs service . the customs service works mostly at ports , airports and the countries borders to make sure that people do not bring things into the country which are banned , or that the right amount of tax has been paid on goods that can be `` imported '' ( brought into the country ) . some customs officers work at a post office . they do not meet the public , they examine letters and parcels which have been sent from outside the country , to make sure nothing illegal is being brought into the country . in the united kingdom the customs service was called `` customs and excise '' . this is because it was once two separate bodies . the customs service collected tax ( called customs duty ) on goods being brought into the country , for example brandy from france or tea from india . the excise service collected tax ( called excise duty ) on goods made in the country , for example scotch whisky or irish whiskey . today all cars and lorries must pay a tax to be allowed to drive on the road . although most people call this `` road tax '' or `` car tax '' , it is officially called `` vehicle excise duty '' .
