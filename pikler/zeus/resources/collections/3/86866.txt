Self-replication     replication is a general word for making a copy . self-replication is a process by which a thing might make a copy of itself . biological cells , in suitable environments , reproduce by cell division . the process is self-organising , given the basic machinery of a cell . during cell division , dna is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction . other kinds of replication occur . rna viruses use the mechanism of a cell to replicate their own rna strand and make its protein coat . retroviruses are one of most important rna viruses ; there are a number of other types . viruses can only reproduce by taking over the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection . computer viruses reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers . memes reproduce using the human mind and culture as their reproductive machinery . references . - von neumann , j. , 1966 , `` the theory of self-reproducing automata '' , a. burks , ed. , univ . of illinois press , urbana , il .
