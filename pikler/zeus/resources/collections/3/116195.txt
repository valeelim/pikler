Sewall Wright     sewall green wright ( 21 december 1889 â€“ 3 march 1988 ) was an american geneticist . he was a founder of population genetics , and contributed to evolutionary theory . he also did original work in statistics in a field called path analysis . with r.a. fisher and j.b.s . haldane , he was a founder of theoretical population genetics . he is the discoverer of the inbreeding coefficient and of methods of computing it in pedigrees . he extended this work to populations , calculating the degree of inbreeding of members of populations as a result of random genetic drift . together with fisher , he pioneered methods for calculating the distribution of gene frequencies among populations as a result of the interaction of natural selection , mutation , migration and genetic drift . the work of fisher , wright , and haldane on theoretical population genetics was a major step in the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis of genetics with evolution . wright also made contributions to mammalian genetics and biochemical genetics .
