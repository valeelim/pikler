Northbridge     the northbridge is one of two basic chips on the motherboard of a computer . the other basic chip is the southbridge and together they create the computer chipset . usually , north- and southbridge are on different ics ; it is rare for both of them to be on one chip . northbridge supports communication between cpu , ram memory , agp port or pci express bus and also supports connection with southbridge . there exist some chipsets which support two types of ram memory and which are accessible during transition to new standard . northbridge is a basic part of motherboard which establishes speed , types of processors , quantity of processors and kind of ram memory . other important factors are , for example , voltage regulation and number of connectors . sequencers of ram memory was , in amd64 architecture , shifted directly into processor . other producers ( like intel or ibm ) also incorporated this change into their new processors . a perspective to the future is soc ( system on chip ) . with it will also decrease the number of components on the motherboard . but bigger chips hold under universality of solution , they have more pins and they are more difficult . present high-speed buses are series ( pcie , sata ) and they decline the complexity . in the future we can expect return to the standard interface of other circuits using bus ( probably pci express ) and maybe they will be connected to the single super i/o sequencer . saved lads can be used for another integrated turn like sata , usb , ide , sdio scanner of cards and sequencers of pci .
