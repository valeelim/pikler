Fra Angelico     fra angelico ( c. 1395â€“ february 18 , 1455 ) , was an italian early renaissance painter . giorgio vasari , who wrote the `` lives of the artists '' said he had `` '' a rare and perfect talent '' '' . fra angelico has been known by many different names . when he was born , he was called guido di pietro . people who knew him when he was older called him fra giovanni da fiesole ( brother john from fiesole ) . when giorgio vasari wrote about him in `` lives of the artists '' , in the 1500s , he was already known as fra giovanni angelico ( brother giovanni who is like an angel ) . the italians usually call him il beato angelico ( the blessed angelico ) . he has been called this for a long time , because he was thought to be blessed by god who gave him the talent of painting , and also because he was such a good and holy man . the name `` blessed angelico '' has now been made official , because in 1982 pope john paul ii `` conferred beatification '' which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint . vasari says about him : `` it is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father , who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said , and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith .
