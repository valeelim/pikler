Ministry for Intra-German Relations     the federal ministry of intra-german relations ( ) was a federal ministry of the federal republic of germany . it was responsible for all relations with the east german government . this was because the west german government said there should be only one germany . this meant they could not use the ministry of foreign affairs , because they could not admit that east germany was a foreign country . the ministry was created in 1949 as the federal ministry of all-german affairs ( ) . this ministry was also in charge of matters about the german lands east of the oder-neisse-line which had become a part of poland . the ministry was renamed in 1969 when willy brandt signed a treaty with poland which said that poland 's western border was along the oder and neisse rivers . this was part of willy brandt 's ideas of ostpolitik . at that time poland was under a communist government . they could not allow west germany to sign a treaty about east germany 's borders , which is why the treaty says `` the western border of poland '' and not `` the border between germany and poland '' .
