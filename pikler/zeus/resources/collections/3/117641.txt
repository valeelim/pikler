Air traffic control     air traffic control ( atc ) is a service provided by ground-based controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and in the air . the main job of atc is to `` separate '' aircraft to prevent crashes and to make sure aircraft are running on time and as fast as possible . in some countries , atc may also play a security or defense role ( as in the united states ) , or actually be run entirely by the military ( as in brazil ) . air traffic control was first introduced at london 's croydon airport in 1921. archie league , who controlled aircraft using colored flags at what is today lambert-st. louis international airport , is often considered the first air traffic controller . preventing crashes is done by what is called `` separation '' . this means that the aircraft are kept apart by a minimum distance at all times . modern aircraft also have collision avoidance systems that see nearby aircraft and warn pilots if other planes are too close . this system is a backup for when air traffic control is not available or if something goes wrong with atc . air traffic controllers also can provide information to pilots . but pilots do not have to follow commands of atc . they can make changes in order to keep plane safe .
