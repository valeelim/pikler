Blizzard     a blizzard is a large winter storm . it brings low temperatures , strong winds , and a lot of blowing snow . blizzards start when a high pressure system touches as low pressure system . the word `` blizzard '' is sometimes used incorrectly by news media to talk about big winter storms , even if the storm is not a blizzard . some areas are more likely to be hit by blizzards than others , but a blizzard can occur in any place where snow falls . in north america , blizzards happen often in the northern-east states , and in the provinces of canada . in this region , blizzards can happen more than twice each winter . they also occur often in the mountain ranges of western north america . because these regions have low populations , blizzards sometimes are not reported . a very dangerous type of blizzard is a whiteout . in a whiteout , downdrafts and snowfall are so thick that people can not tell the ground and sky apart . people caught in a whiteout lose their sense of direction very fast . this is a large danger to pilots when they are flying airplanes , because they can not tell how close they are to the ground , and may crash .
