Theremin     the theremin , ( also thereminvox or aetherphone ) is one of the first fully electronic musical instruments . it was invented by russian inventor l√©on theremin in october 1920 after the outbreak of the russian civil war . its invention grew out of a search for ways to detect movement . it was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched . the control section has two metal antennae to sense the positions of the player 's hands . one hand controls the pitch . the other hand controls the volume . to play the theremin , the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas . the electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker . the sound of the theremin is associated with `` alien , '' surreal , and eerie-sounding portamento , glissando , tremolo , and vibrato sounds . it has been used in film soundtracks such as `` spellbound '' , `` the lost weekend '' , `` ed wood '' , `` mars attacks ! '' and `` the day the earth stood still '' . the theremin was a key feature of the bbc radiophonic workshop , which produced the theme music for several bbctv programs . theremins are also used in art music ( especially avant-garde and 20th century `` new music '' ) and in popular music genres such as rock and pop . the russian dmitri shostakovich was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces , including a use in his score for the 1931 film `` odna '' .
