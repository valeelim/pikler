Missouri Valley Conference     the missouri valley conference ( mvc ) is a college sports conference in the united states that sponsors many sports , but has not played football since the 1984 season . the mvc has its roots in the missouri valley intercollegiate athletic association ( mviaa ) , a league formed in 1907 by several schools in the midwestern united states . the mviaa split into two leagues in 1928. one league , made up mostly of large schools , kept the mviaa name and years later became the big eight conference . the smaller schools formed the mvc . both groups claimed a 1907 founding date , and the same history up to the 1928 split . however , the big eight merged in 1996 with several schools from the collapsing southwest conference to form today 's big 12 conference , which does not claim any of the big eight 's history . because of this , only the mvc now has a claim to any of the mviaa 's history . currently , the mvc has 10 members . the mvc has four `` associate members '' , each of which plays one sport in the conference .
