Tanakh     tanakh is an acronym that is almost the same thing as saying the `` hebrew bible . '' it has three parts called the torah , which has the first five books , the nevi'im , which has the books of hebrew prophets , and the ketuvim , which has the rest of the books . it takes its name from the first ( hebrew ) letter of each of these parts . the tanakh is the jewish holy book , although most would say the torah is , but it is just the most important part out of the three parts of the tanakh .
