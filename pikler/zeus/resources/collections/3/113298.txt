Austro-Bavarian language     bavarian or austro-bavarian is a major group of upper german varieties . like standard german , austro-bavarian is a high german language , but they are not the same language . however , austro-bavarian and standard german have influenced each other and the vast majority of austro-bavarian speakers speak standard german as well . austro-bavarian is also used to refer to the dialect group which includes the austro-bavarian dialect discussed here , as well as the cimbrian , hutterite german , and mócheno dialects of germany . the austro-bavarian language has its origins in the germanic tribe known as the bavarii , who established a tribal duchy , which covered much of what is today bavaria and some of austria in the early middle ages and was eventually subdued by charlemagne . however , they gradually migrated down the danube and into the alps to all those areas where austro-bavarian dialects are spoken . in german , there is usually a difference made between `` bairisch '' ( referring to the language ) and `` bayerisch '' ( referring to the state of bavaria and used in the name of bmw ) . because of king ludwig i 's passion for everything hellenic , the german name for bavaria today is spelled `` bayern '' , while the language spoken there has retained its original spelling `` bairisch '' —note the i versus the `` hellenic '' y .
