Bernoulli's principle    bernoulli 's principle bernoulli 's principle is a concept of fluid dynamics . it says that when an incompressible fluid moves through different sizes of tube , the fluid 's speed changes . this change in velocity is called `` acceleration '' . newton showed that acceleration only occurs through the action of a force . when a force acts over an area , it is called `` pressure '' . a higher pressure pushes ( accelerates ) fluid toward lower pressure . so any change in a fluid 's speed must be matched by a change in pressure ( force ) . bernoulli saw that while the speed of the flow went up in the smaller part of the tube , the pressure went down . please note that this refers to changes in speed and pressure along a single path of flow and does not apply to two different flows at different speeds . basically , the bernoulli principle says that as speed of the fluid increases , pressure decreases . the photo on the right shows this happening . the air in the wide part of the tube has a higher static pressure than the thin part . for a steady flow , the amount of fluid entering the pipe must equal the amount leaving the pipe , so the fluid speed in the thin part must increase .
