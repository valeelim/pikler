Fingerprint scanner     fingerprint scanners are security systems of biometrics . they are now used in police stations , security industries and most recently , on computers . everyone has marks on their fingers . they can not be removed or changed . these marks have a pattern and this pattern is called the fingerprint . every fingerprint is special , and different from any other in the world . because there are countless combinations , fingerprints have become an ideal means of identification . there are four types of fingerprint scanners : the optical scanner , the capacitance scanner , the 'ultrasonic scanner ' and the thermal scanners . the basic function of these three types of scanners is to get an image of a person â€™ s fingerprint and find a match for this print in the database . the capacitance scanner is better , because the images are more exact and precise . scanners are used for scanning . 1. optical scanners take a visual image of the fingerprint using a digital camera . 1. capacitive or cmos scanners use capacitors and thus electrical current to form an image of the fingerprint .
