David Livingstone     david livingstone ( 19 march 1813 â€“ 4 may 1873 ) was a scottish medical missionary with the london missionary society . he wanted to be a missionary , but he could not get many people to convert to christian beliefs , so instead , he explored and charted much of southern and eastern africa . he gave the victoria falls their name . he named them after his queen , queen victoria . as an explorer , livingstone had some advantages . he usually travelled lightly , and he was able to reassure chiefs that he was not a threat . other expeditions had dozens of soldiers armed with rifles , and scores of hired porters carrying supplies . they were often seen as military incursions or were mistaken for slave-raiding parties . livingstone travelled on most of his journeys with a few servants and porters , bartering for supplies along the way . he only had a couple of guns for protection . he preached a christian message but did not force it on unwilling ears . he understood the ways of local chiefs , and got permission to go through their territory . he was often hospitably received and aided , even by mwata kazembe .
