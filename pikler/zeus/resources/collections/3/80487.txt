Leberkäse     the cook of the bavarian duke karl theodor is said to have invented leberkäse in 1776. many people believe this to be false though . the word `` leberkäse '' literally translates to `` liver-cheese '' . in bavaria there is neither cheese nor liver in the dish , though . some linguists say , that the word may be related to the german word `` laib '' ( loaf ) . perhaps it also contains the slavic root `` quas '' ( yeast ) . according to german food laws , only products called `` bavarian leberkäse '' are allowed not to have liver in them ; otherwise , there must be a minimum liver content of 4 % . some local variants must contain even more liver ; for example , the liver content of `` stuttgarter leberkäse '' must be at least 5 % . there are several ways of eating leberkäse : - cut into approximately finger-thick slices which are then placed in a semmel while still hot and seasoned with mustard . the result , generally called `` leberkässemmel '' , is a staple of bavarian and austrian fast food restaurants . - alternatively , the slices can also be pan-fried ( `` abgebräunt '' , browned ) , in which case they are commonly accompanied by a fried egg and german potato salad . this is a very common biergarten dish sometimes called `` strammer max '' .
