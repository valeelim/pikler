Eclipse     an eclipse is an astronomical event . it is a process that develops slowly across time . the eclipse is when one object in the sky moves into the shadow of another such object . when an eclipse happens within a system of stars , like the solar system , it makes a type of syzygy . this means that three or more objects in the sky are lined up in a straight line in the same gravitational system . the term `` eclipse '' is most often used to describe a `` solar eclipse '' , when the moon 's shadow crosses the earth 's surface , or a `` lunar eclipse '' , when the moon moves into the shadow of earth . no solar eclipse can last longer than 7 minutes and 58 seconds because of the speed at which the earth and moon move . when the sun is not involved , the event is called occultation . the word comes from the ancient greek noun ( ' ) , which is from the verb ( ' ) . this means `` to cease ( stop ) to exist ( be there ) '' .
