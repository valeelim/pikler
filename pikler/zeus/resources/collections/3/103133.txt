International health     international health means two different , but related , things . it means care of people who travel from one country to another , and knowledge of diseases foreign to the traveler . it also means people from one country trying to improve health in another . there are different kinds of groups that are involved in international health . they engage in international health for different reasons and with different ethics and rules . governments of rich , `` developed '' countries are often interested in the health of other countries . they are especially interested in the health of neighbor countries . the reasons for this are many : if they have extra resources , they may want to share them with their neighbors ; but also they may want to stop spread of diseases from their neighbor country across the border . for example , the united states is a richer country than mexico and has little problem with measles ( in children ) or rabies ( in mammals ) in the interior , but along the border with mexico these diseases are more common .
