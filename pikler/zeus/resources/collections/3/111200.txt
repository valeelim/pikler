Hominid     a hominid is any member of the biological family hominidae . these are the `` great apes '' , living and extinct . at present there are humans , chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans . the word `` hominid '' has been used in various ways . the classification of the great apes has been revised several times in the last few decades . these revisions led to different uses of the word `` hominid '' . the original meaning of the taxon hominidae meant only humans and their closest relatives . now this group is called the hominina . the primatological term hominid is easily confused with a number of very similar words : - a hominoid or ape is a member of the superfamily `` hominoidea '' : existing members are the lesser apes ( gibbons ) and great apes . - a hominid is a member of the family `` hominidae '' : all of the great apes . - a hominine is a member of the subfamily `` homininae '' : gorillas , chimpanzees , humans ( excludes orangutans ) . - a hominin is a member of the tribe `` hominini '' : including humans . - a hominan is a little used term for a sub-tribe . it is only used by people who put chimpanzees in the hominini .
