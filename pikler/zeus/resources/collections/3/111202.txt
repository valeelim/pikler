Treaty of Berlin (1878)    treaty of berlin ( 1878 ) the treaty of berlin was a part of the congress of berlin ( june 13-july 13 , 1878 ) . in it , the united kingdom , austria-hungary , france , germany , italy , russia and the ottoman empire wrote the treaty of san stefano . the most important problem in the treaty was deciding what would happen to the kingdom of bulgaria . however , russia insisted that bulgaria should not be talked about in the treaty . the previous treaty of san stefano had created a huge bulgarian state which was just what great britain and austria-hungary did not want . the treaty said that romania , serbia and montenegro were to become independent . the ottoman province of bosnia-herzegovina was given to austria-hungary . the three newly-independent states soon declared themselves kingdoms ( romania in 1881 , serbia in 1882 and montenegro in 1910 ) . austria-hungary took bosnia officially in 1908 , causing the major european crisis .
