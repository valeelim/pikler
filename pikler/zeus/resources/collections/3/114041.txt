Cluniac Reforms     the cluniac ( clunian ) reform was a series of changes within medieval monasticism . the reforms focused on restoring the traditional life in the monasteries . monasteries should encourage the production of artworks . they should also care for the poor . the reform is named after the abbey of cluny in burgundy . it started in the benedictine order there . the reform was largely carried out by saint odo . it spread through france ( burgundy , provence , auvergne , poitou ) , england and much of italy and spain . the reform was stated , because there was corruption in the benedictine order . people thought this corruption came because people that were not priests and that came from outside the monasteries interfered with them . a benetictine monastery needed land . this land was given by a feudal lord . by giving the land , the lord would become the patron of the monastery . however , he would often demand the right to interfere in the business of the monastery . the cluny reform was an attempt to change this practice . a more independent abbot would have better success at enforcing the rule of the order , it was thought . william of aquitaine formed the first cluny monastery in 910 with the novel stipulation that the monastery would report directly to the pope rather than to a local lord . this meant essentially that the monastery would be independent , since the pope 's authority was largely theoretical at that distance .
