Golden ratio     if a person has one number `` a '' and another smaller number `` b '' , he can make the ratio of the two numbers by dividing them . their ratio is `` a '' / '' b '' . the person can make another ratio by adding the two numbers together `` a '' + '' b '' and dividing this by the larger number `` a '' . the new ratio is ( `` a '' + '' b '' ) / '' a '' . if these two ratios are equal to the same number , then that number is called the golden ratio . the greek letter formula_1 ( phi ) is usually used as the name for the golden ratio . for example , if `` b '' = 1 and `` a '' / '' b '' = formula_1 , then `` a '' = formula_1 . the second ratio ( `` a '' + '' b '' ) / '' a '' is then formula_4 . because these two ratios are equal , this is true : formula_5 one way to write this number is formula_6 formula_7 is like any number which , when multiplied by itself , makes 5 ( or which number is multiplied ) : formula_8 . the golden ratio is an irrational number . if a person tries to write it , it will never stop and never be the same again and again , but it will start this way : 1.6180339887 ... an important thing about this number is that a person can subtract 1 from it or divide 1 by it . either way , the number will still keep going and never stop .
