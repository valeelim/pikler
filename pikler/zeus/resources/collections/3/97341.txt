Class (programming)    class ( programming ) a class is a part of a computer program that a programmer creates to represent a thing in a way that a computer can understand . a class is written in a programming language and a programming language that can be used to write classes is called an object-oriented programming language . classes have fields , which represent a quality the thing has , and classes have methods , which represent what a thing can do . for example , a class could be a car , which could have a color field , four tire fields , and a drive method . another related class could be a truck , which would have similar fields , but not be exactly the same as a car . both a car and a truck could be a kind of a third class which could be called a vehicle class . in this way , the programmer could create the parts of the program that are the same for both the car and the truck in programming the vehicle class , yet the programmer would be free to program how a car is different from a truck without duplicating all of the programming .
