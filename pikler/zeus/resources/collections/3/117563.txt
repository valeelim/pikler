MINIX     minix is a unix-like computer operating system based on a microkernel architecture . andrew s. tanenbaum wrote the operating system so it could be used for educational purposes ; minix also helped linus torvalds design the linux kernel . its name comes from the words `` minimal '' and `` unix '' . released under the bsd license , minix is free and open source . andrew s. tanenbaum created minix at vrije universiteit in amsterdam . minix 3 was announced to the public on 24 october 2005 by andrew tanenbaum during his speech on top of the acm symposium operating system principles conference . minix 3 currently supports only ia-32 architecture pc systems . it has a live cd format that lets it be used on a computer without installing it . version 3.1.2 was released 8 may 2006. it contains x11 , emacs , vi , cc , gcc , perl , python , ash , bash , zsh , ftp , ssh , telnet , pine , and over 400 other common unix programs . with the addition of x11 , this version starts the change from a text-only system . the design principles tanenbaum applied to minix had influenced the design decisions linus torvalds applied in the creation of the linux kernel . torvalds used and appreciated minix , but his design was different from the minix architecture in significant ways , most notably by employing a monolithic kernel instead of a microkernel . this was famously disapproved by tanenbaum in the tanenbaum-torvalds debate . ( tanenbaum explained again his rationale for using a microkernel in may 2006 . )
