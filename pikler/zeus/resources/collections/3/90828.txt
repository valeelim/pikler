Aswan Low Dam     the aswan low dam or old aswan dam is a dam across the nile river in aswan , egypt . it is built of masonry and held in place just by gravity . it was the first dam across the nile , and was built by the british between 1899 and 1902. when it was done , it was the largest masonry dam in the world . this type of dam is called a buttress dam . the dam was built at the former first cataract of the nile , and is about 1000 km up-river and 690 km ( direct distance ) south-southeast of cairo . when initially constructed between 1899 and 1902 , nothing of its scale had ever been attempted . the dam was designed to provide storage of annual floodwater . the water was used to help dry season flow and support more irrigation . its height was originally limited because of concern for the temple of isis at phillae ( philae temple ) . that temple was later moved to agilkia island in lake nasser . the dam provided inadequate storage capacity for planned development and was raised twice , between 1907–1912 and again 1929–1933 . these heightenings still did not meet irrigation demands and in 1946 it was nearly over-topped by water in an effort to maximize pool elevation .
