Nuclear accident     by now , the most serious nuclear accident has been the chernobyl disaster in 1986. other serious nuclear accidents include fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident , three mile island accident , the windscale fire , mayak accident , and the sl-1 accident . in the period to 2007 , 63 major nuclear accidents have occurred at nuclear power plants . twenty-nine of these have occurred since the chernobyl disaster , and 71 percent of all nuclear accidents ( 45 out of 63 ) occurred in the united states . on 11 march 2011 , the magnitude 9.0 devastating sendai earthquake and tsunami took place in japan . as a result , `` fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant '' , `` fukushima daini nuclear power plant '' , `` onagawa nuclear power plant '' and `` tōkai nuclear power plant stations '' consisting of eleven ( 11 ) reactors were automatically shut down following the earthquake . at fukushima daiichi and daini tsunami waves went over seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems . this loss of power caused severe problems including two large explosions at fukushima daiichi and leakage of radiation . over 200,000 people have been evacuated . seismic recordings at six assessed nuclear power plant facilities indicated the plants had been exposed to `` peak ground accelerations '' of 0.037–0.383 '' g '' and `` peak ground velocities of 6.18–52.62 cm/sec .
