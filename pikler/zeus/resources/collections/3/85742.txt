Courante     a courante ( ) is a dance that was popular in baroque music in the 17th and early 18th centuries . the word comes from the french word for to `` run '' . the courante was a fast , running dance with 3 beats in a bar ( the time signature was often 3/2 , although sometimes it was 3/4 ) . during the 17th century the french courante started to become slower than the italian corrente , and it often had more counterpoint ( imitating parts ) . however , this was not a strict rule , and the courantes that bach wrote were both italian and french in style , and sometimes he called them `` courante '' and sometimes `` corrente '' . composers of the baroque period often composed a group of several dances . this was called a suite . there was usually an allemande , then the courante was the second dance , followed by a sarabande and a gigue and sometimes one or two other dances or as well .
