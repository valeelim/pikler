Big East Conference     the big east conference is a college sports conference in the united states which sponsors many sports , but does not play football . the league has its roots in the original big east conference , which was founded in 1979 as a basketball-focused league by a group of schools in the eastern u.s. that league added football in 1991 , leading to years of conflict between schools that played top-level football and those that did not . in july 2013 , the original league split along football lines . the seven schools that did not play fbs ( top-level ) football—often called the `` catholic 7 '' because all are run by the catholic church—bought the `` big east '' name and formed a new big east . the fbs schools joined with several new members and stayed in the original big east structure under the new name of american athletic conference ( the american ) . although the current big east was not founded until 2013 , it claims the 1979 founding date of the original big east . both the current big east and the american claim the pre-split history of the old big east .
