Evangelism     evangelism is the christian practice of preaching about jesus christ to both christians and non-christians . the purpose of most `` evangelism '' is to help others receive eternal ( forever ) salvation to people who have not heard of , or have denied god . `` evangelism '' is done in obedience to the great commission , a command from jesus to his disciples to convert others , as recorded in the new testament . christians who are good at `` evangelism '' are known as evangelists , whether in their areas or to far away places . some christian traditions consider `` evangelists '' to be in a leadership position , and they may be found preaching to large meetings . although most christian denominations perform some sort of evangelism , evangelicalistic and pentecostal denominations are very focused on this issue .
