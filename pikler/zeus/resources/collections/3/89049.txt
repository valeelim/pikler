Storage area network     a storage area network ( san ) is a computing solution for accessing and storing data . to the user , storage area networks appear to be local to the operating system , but they are actually remote . to understand the difference between a san and network attached storage ( nas ) , the difference between the file system and storage must be made clear . the file system is the interface that allows the user to access their data that is stored in physical storage ( such as hard disks ) . from the point of view of the user , their data is saved as files . the file system takes care of storing the file data , which might actually be broken up into pieces and stored in different locations in storage . on a personal computer , the file system and storage are on the same machine ( direct attached storage ) . in network attached storage , the file system and storage are on a remote server . in a storage area network , the file system is on the local machine , and the storage is on a remote machine .
