Adobe     adobe is a building material made from soil and often organic matter . adobe means mudbrick in spanish . it can also mean any kind of earth construction . adobe is one of the earliest building materials ever used . it is found all over the world . the techniques used in adobe construction have not changed since the 16th century in the southwestern united states . because they are not fired in a kiln they never become hard . they shrink and swell as the water content in them changes . also , as they get wetter , they become weaker . adobe does not permanently stick to wood , metal or stone because it moves more than they do . this causes cracks and seperation from other materials . stone is sometimes used as a foundation and wood for the roof . these are usually held in place by their own weight or the weight of the adobe pressing down on them . but adobe construction is cheap and the materials are usually easy to find .
