Shoulder rest     a shoulder rest is something which is used by people who play the violin or the viola . it may be made of wood , aluminium , carbon fiber or plastic . usually , the shoulder rest attaches to the edge of the violin with `` feet '' padded with rubber tubing or made of soft plastic . the purpose of a shoulder rest is to help the player to be comfortable holding the violin , which is held between the chin and the shoulder . not all players use a shoulder rest . many violinists prefer just to put a piece of cloth or some other form of padding on their shoulder . whether a player uses a shoulder rest may depend on whether he or she has a long neck , and whether he is wearing clothes made with thick or thin material . it is important that the player can shift his left hand easily and freely to play in the higher positions without being afraid that he will drop the instrument , and without feeling the need to squeeze the instrument between his chin and shoulder as this will make the muscles in his neck very tight .
