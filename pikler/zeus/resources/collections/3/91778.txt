Fundamentalism     fundamentalism was used at first to describe some people in the protestant community in the united states in the early 20th century . these people had a set of well-defined ( `` fundamental '' ) values . these values were in opposition to more modern ideas . the group also said it was important to stick to what faith ( the bible ) told them . when people look at religion this way they see the ideas in the religion as `` absolute '' . this means that it is not possible for them to change . when religion is seen as absolute it becomes fundamentalism . today , the term is used more generally . it is now often used to describe groups of people who will stick to their ( mostly moral , and religious ) values even though these values may be criticised by many people . these values may also be unpopular . modern-day fundamentalists want to go back to the roots of certain ideological or religious positions . religious fundamentalism has been prevalent in society since its beginnings in the late 19th- and early 20th-century . people today who study fundamentalism see it as a response to modern society . today society is not as simple as it was : many people live in societies that can be difficult to understand . changes in familiar things can make people feel unsafe . so some people look in their religion to see something that does not change . they also want rules about how to act that do not change . so they see their religion as this thing that does not change .
