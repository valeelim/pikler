Mellotron     the mellotron is a musical instrument , which appeared in the 1960s . it was the world 's second sampled keyboard after the chamberlin . mellotrons contained loops made from the sounds of other musical instruments . instead of sounding exactly like the original instruments , the mellotron had a unique sound . mellotrons did not travel well , and had to be carefully set up every time they were moved . they became popular in recording studios , and with musicians who could leave them in one location . the beatles liked the sound of the mellotron , and used it in many of their songs , like `` strawberry fields forever '' . john lennon , a member of the beatles , owned a mellotron that he kept in his home studio . paul mccartney and george harrison , also members of the band , owned mellotrons and used them in their solo recordings . harry nilsson also used a mellotron on some of his recordings . mellotrons are largely obsolete but are still being made in small quantities . today , digital instruments have mostly taken their place . digital keyboards are portable , and can be used to make similar sounds anywhere . while digital keyboards have been used since the 1980 's to replicate the sounds of many other instruments , they can not accurately replicate the nuances and idiosyncrasies of the mellotron because of complex physics involved in the tape playback system . this acknowledged drawback has led to the production of new mellotrons since 1999 .
