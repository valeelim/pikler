Stalagmite     a stalagmite is a form that can be found on the floor of a cave . it rises from the floor of a limestone cave when mineralized solutions drip from the ceiling and deposits of calcium carbonate form columns on the ground . the corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite . there are several methods to help remember which formation hangs from the ceiling ( stalactite ) and which rises from the floor ( stalagmite ) : - stalactite has a `` c '' for `` ceiling '' . - stalagmite has a `` g '' for `` ground '' . - the t in stalactite resembles one hanging from the ceiling , while the m in stalagmite resembles a formation rising from the floor . when touring caves with stalactites and stalagmites you might be asked to not touch the rock formations . this is generally because the formation is considered to still be growing and forming . since the rock buildup is formed by minerals solidifying out of the water solution , skin oils can disturb where the mineral water will cling . so the development of the rock formation will be affected and not natural anymore .
