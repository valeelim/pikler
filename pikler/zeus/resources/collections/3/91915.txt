Ruins     ruins are the parts of buildings that are left after they have been destroyed and can not be used properly any more . many ruins are ancient and famous like the ruins of the forum of ancient rome , or the ruins of tintagel castle on the coast of cornwall . ruins can be caused by wars or by natural disasters such as earthquakes , fires and volcanos . sometimes people leave a house or a village to stand empty , and move somewhere else . when this happens , the house or village slowly becomes a ruin . historic ruins are often a good place for archaeologists to search for evidence of the way people used to live . often the ruins have all sorts of interesting things buried in them . archaeologists call the things that they find `` artefacts '' . artefacts might include beautiful artworks , jewellry and gold coins but usually they are ordinary things like cooking pots , mugs , spoons , hair combs , pipes , old shoes , broken toys and rats ' nests . historians use the evidence found by the archaeologists to write about the place and what might have happened there .
