Margrave     a margrave ( ) is a german nobleman . originally the holy roman emperor would give a markgraf an area of the borders ( the marches or ) to look after . the margrave would have to protect the people in the area from invaders , and at the same time protect the empire . a markgraf ranked higher than a count or earl ( ) , but lower than a duke . the margraves of brandenburg were in control of such an important area that they were made electors of the holy roman empire , which was the highest honour in the imperial parliament . there were no kings in the empire , so when the margraves of brandenburg took control of some territory outside the empire as well , they could call themselves king in prussia . as the middle ages ended and europe and the holy roman empire became more secure the military importance of the margraves became less . at the end of the german empire in 1918 , there were no markgrafs left . all had been given higher title , but may have kept the markgraf title as an extra . the kings of prussia , for example , always kept the lower title margraves of brandenburg .
