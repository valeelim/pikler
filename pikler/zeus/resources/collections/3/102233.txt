Scouting     scouting ( sometimes called the scout movement ) is a youth movement . it was started in 1907 by robert baden-powell as a movement for boys . baden-powell took many ideas from the experiences he made with the mafeking cadet corps . this corps was a paramilitary group made of boys . it was formed during a siege in the second boer war . the boys mainly carried messages . this was so the soldiers could focus on defending the city . originally , the scout movement was for boys only . a similar movement for girls , called `` girl guides '' was started in 1910. in most countries there are associations for scouts and for girl guides . today the scouts often accept girls , too . in the scout movement , people learn to work together to achieve a goal . they also train their character to become better adults . usually scouts give a promise to live by certain rules , and to help others when they can . scouts spend their time outdoors , whenever possible . in 2005 , there were more than 28 million boy scouts and over 10 million girl guides . they came from 216 different countries . there were only six countries with no scout movement in 2006. they were andorra , people 's republic of china , cuba , laos , myanmar and north korea .
