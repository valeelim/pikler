Thomas Morley     thomas morley ( born at norwich ? , 1557 or 1558 ; died at london , october 1602 ) was an english composer , music theorist and organist . he was the most important english composer of madrigals . he studied the madrigals by italian composers and created the tradition of the english madrigal , a tradition that became extremely popular , but which only lasted about 30 years . morley â€™ s father was a brewer who lived in norwich , so it is likely that morley was born there . he may have been a choirboy in norwich cathedral . we know that in 1583 he got the job of organist there . in a book he published later in his life he said that william byrd was his master . if this means that he had lessons from byrd he must have travelled away from norwich . in 1588 he got a degree from oxford , and soon afterwards he became an organist at st. paul 's cathedral in london . in 1588 nicholas yonge published a book called `` musica transalpina '' . it was a collection of italian madrigals with words translated into english . soon after this morley started to publish his own madrigals . in 1592 he became a gentleman of the chapel royal .
