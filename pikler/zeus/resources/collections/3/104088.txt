Zeeland     zeeland ( also called zealand ) is a province in netherlands . it is on the south-western part of the country . about 380,000 people live in this province . zeeland is a good example of land partly reclaimed from water or marshes . it is a large river delta at the mouth of several major rivers . most of the province lies below sea level and was reclaimed from the sea . what was a muddy landscape , flooding at high tide and reappearing at low tide , became a series of small man-made hills that stayed dry . the people of the province connected the hills by making dikes . this made a chain of dry land which grew bigger , and gave the province its present shape . the north sea flood of 1953 swamped vast amounts of land . building the protective delta works also changed the face of the province . dams , tunnels and bridges are a vital part of the province 's road system . the final touch to this process came in 2003 when the western scheldt tunnel was opened . it was the first solid connection between both banks of the western scheldt and ended the era of water separating the islands and peninsulas of zeeland .
