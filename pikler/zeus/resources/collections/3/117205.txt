Mediterranean Ridge     the mediterranean ridge is a wide ridge in the floor of the mediterranean sea . it is next to a rough quarter circle from calabria , south of crete , to the southwest corner of turkey , and from there eastwards south of turkey , with cyprus . from what tectonic theory says , it is caused by the african plate subducting under the eurasian and anatolian plates . as the african plate moves slowly north-northeastward , it plows up the floor of the mediterranean , lifting it from the seabed , and then above sea level , making the island of cyprus . if the northward movement of africa continues , the ridge might grow into a long and high mountain range and destroy the mediterranean sea . other websites . - map of the `` mediterranean ridge ''
