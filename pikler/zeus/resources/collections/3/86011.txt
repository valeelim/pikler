Philosophy of science     philosophy of science is the part of philosophy that studies the sciences . philosophers who are interested in science study how knowledge is built up by scientists , and what makes science different from other activities . no doubt , modern science has advanced knowledge in a wide range of fields . how has it done this ? to tackle this issue , a number of other issues have to be tackled also . in earlier times , some have thought science was nothing but organised common sense . thomas henry huxley thought this . however , as the twentieth century went on , science produced many ideas which were nothing like common sense . then it was clear that science really was something different from commonsense knowledge . but what was it ? this is called the demarcation problem . the demarcation problem refers to the distinction between science and non-science ( including pseudoscience ) . karl popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science . no account of the problem has got full agreement among philosophers ; some regard the problem as insoluble or uninteresting .
