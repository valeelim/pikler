Sedimentary rock     sedimentary rocks are rocks formed from sediment . they are deposited over time , and often show layers which can be seen in cliffs . other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock . sediments are usually formed from matter which falls to the bottom of oceans and lakes . the matter includes tiny pieces of other rocks , and dead animals , plants and microorganisms . also , inorganic chemicals may be precipitated from solution in the water . the three most common sedimentary rocks are limestone , sandstone and shale . sedimentary rocks cover 7580 % of the earth 's land area , but they make up only 5 % of the earth 's crust . the relative abundances of the different types of sedimentary rocks are : - shale -- -- -- -- -- 60 % - sandstone -- -20 % - carbonate -- -15 % - all others -- -- -5 % squeezed and compressed over time , the sediments become 'consolidated ' ( made solid ) into layers of rock . cementation occurs when dissolved mineral components deposit in the interstices of sediments . it is the sticking together of sediment that forms a rock .
