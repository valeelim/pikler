Homo erectus     homo erectus ( latin : `` upright man '' ) is an extinct species of the genus `` homo '' . fossil remains were found in java ( 1890s ) and in china ( 1921 ) . nearly all of them were lost during world war ii , but there are casts that are considered to be reliable evidence . early in the 20th century it was believed that the first modern humans lived in asia . but during the 1950s and 1970s , many fossil finds from east africa ( kenya ) showed that the oldest hominins came from there . `` h. erectus '' had a cranial capacity ( brain size ) greater than that the earlier `` homo habilis '' . the earliest `` h. erectus '' remains have a cranial capacity of 850 cm³ , while the latest javan specimens measure up to 1100 cm³ . this overlaps that of `` h. sapiens '' : the frontal bone is less sloped and the dental arcade smaller than in australopithecines . the face is more vertical ( less protrusive ) than either the australopithecines or `` h. habilis '' , with large brow-ridges and less prominent cheekbones . these early hominins stood about , only 17 percent of modern male humans are taller . they were slender , with long arms and legs .
