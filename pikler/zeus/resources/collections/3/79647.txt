Proteus (moon)    proteus ( moon ) proteus or neptune viii , is the second biggest moon of neptune , and its biggest close moon . it is named after proteus , the shape-changing sea god of greek mythology . proteus was found from the images taken by `` voyager 2 '' probe during the neptune flyby in 1989. it got the designation s/1989 n 1. stephen p. synnott and bradford a. smith said ( iauc 4806 ) its discovery on july 7 , 1989 , speaking only of “ 17 frames taken over 21 days ” , which gives a discovery date of sometime before june 16. the name was given on 16 september 1991. proteus is more than 400 kilometres in diameter , bigger than nereid , another moon of neptune . however , it was not found by earth-based telescopes because it is so close to the planet that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight . proteus is one of the darkest objects in the solar system . like saturn 's moon phoebe , it reflects only 6 percent of the sunlight that hits it . proteus is very cratered , showing no sign of any geological changes . it is also not a sphere ; scientists believe proteus is about as big as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity . saturn 's moon mimas has much more spherical shape despite being less massive than proteus .
