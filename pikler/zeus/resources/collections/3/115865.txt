Hour record     the hour record for bicycles is the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour on a bicycle . the first recorded hour record was in 1876 when f. l. dodds rode 26.508 kilometres on a penny-farthing bicycle . many people since then have tried to be the fastest . people trying to break the record have helped to change bicycle designs . in 1972 , the belgian cyclist eddy merckx set a record of 49.431 kilometres . it was the record for twelve years . since that time technology has allowed much more aerodynamic bicycle designs . the union cycliste internationale ( uci ) , the group that controls the sport of cycling , has made rules to make cyclists ride cycles similar to merckx 's bicycle . instead there is now another record , the international human powered vehicle association ( ihva ) hour record , for other designs . the hour record for regular bicycles is called the uci record . ond≈ôej sosenka holds the uci hour record at 49.700 kilometres . sam whittingham holds the ihva hour record at 86.752 kilometres .
