Sound recording     sound recording is the storage of sound so that a person can hear the same sound more than once . it is a process wherein sound waves are captured by a machine . the machine converts the waves into electrical signals or digital data , that are then stored on recording media ( such as gramophone records , cassette tapes , compact discs or computer hard drives ) . the sound can then be played back by reversing the process . most recordings are of music , people speaking or singing , and sound effects . they are usually used for entertainment ( fun ) , or for scientific and historical reasons . sound is recorded onto a medium by different methods . the ways that recordings are made have changed a lot since sound was first recorded . the first machines for recording sound were mechanical , not electrical . the phonograph was invented by thomas alva edison in 1877. phonographs have a spinning cylinder covered in a soft material such as tin foil , lead , wax , or amberol . sound waves shake a small needle so that its motion carries the waves . as the cylinder turns , the needle draws the motion of the sound waves in the soft coating . this made the cylinder a recording of the sound that was in the needle .
