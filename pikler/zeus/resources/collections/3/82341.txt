Penance     penance is repentance of sins , as well as the name of the catholic sacrament of penance and reconciliation/confession . the word `` penance '' comes from the latin `` poenitentia '' , the same root as penitence , which in english means repentance , the desire to be forgiven , or contrition : in many languages there is only one single word for it . penance and repentance were similar in their original sense . after the controversy about the merits of `` faith '' and `` good works '' they are seen as conflicting views . the sacrament of reconciliation , also called penance or confession , is a sacrament in the roman catholic church . it is a way for people to be forgiven of their sins , or things they do wrong . they are reconciled , or brought closer to god . this sacrament heals their soul because all of their sins are taken away . it brings many graces , or blessings and good things , to the person who receives it . the person who comes to this sacrament must confess , or tell , their sins to a catholic priest or bishop . it is private , so no one else hears what the person tells the priest . after that , the person says a prayer that shows they are sorry for their sins . then , the priest says a prayer to forgive them .
