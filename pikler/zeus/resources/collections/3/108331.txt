Palestinian legislative election, 2006    palestinian legislative election , 2006 on january 25 2006 , palestinians voted for the palestinian legislative council ( plc ) , the legislature of the palestinian national authority ( pna ) . without counting the 2005 municipal elections and the january 9 , 2005 presidential election , this was the first election to the plc since 1996 ; since then , elections had been delayed several times due to the continuing israeli-palestinian conflict . palestinian voters in the gaza strip and the west bank including east jerusalem were allowed to participate in the election . final results show that hamas won the election , with 74 seats . the ruling party , fatah , only got 45 , giving hamas the majority of the 132 available seats and the chance to form a majority government on their own . analysis of election results shows that the number of seats each party won agrees with their percentage of the vote for the 66 list seats . hamas is overrepresented in the 66 district seats because it nominated more strategically than fatah and did not have to compete with third parties and independents for the same voters ' support .
