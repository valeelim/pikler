Conjecture     a conjecture is an idea in mathematics that appears `` likely '' to be true but that has not been `` proven '' to be true . after a conjecture is proven to be true , it becomes a theorem . until recently , one of the most famous conjectures was fermat 's last theorem . the name was incorrect , because although fermat said he had a proof for it , none could be found in his notes . in 1992 , british mathematician andrew wiles found a proof for it , making it a theorem and not a conjecture . other famous conjectures include : - there are no odd perfect numbers - goldbach 's conjecture - the twin prime conjecture - the collatz conjecture - the riemann hypothesis - p versus np - the poincar√© conjecture ( proven by grigori perelman ) not every conjecture can be proven true or false . the continuum hypothesis , which describes the size of certain infinite sets , is an example . it was shown to be independent of the generally accepted axioms of set theory , which means that it can not be proven true or false using those axioms . it is therefore possible to take this statement , or its negation , as a new axiom in a consistent manner ( much as we can take euclid 's parallel postulate as either true or false ) .
