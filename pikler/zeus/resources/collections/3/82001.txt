Sycorax (moon)    sycorax ( moon ) sycorax is one of uranus ' moons . it is the biggest retrograde non-spherical one of its moons . sycorax was found on september 6 , 1997 by brett j. gladman , philip d. nicholson , joseph a. burns , and john j. kavelaars . they found it using the 200-inch hale telescope . they also found caliban . sycorax was given the designation s/1997 u 2. sycorax was confirmed as uranus xvii . it was named after sycorax , caliban 's mother in william shakespeare 's play `` the tempest '' . sycorax follows a far orbit , more than 20 times farther from uranus than the farthest regular moon oberon . its orbit is retrograde , moderately inclined and eccentric . the orbital parameters suggest that it may belong , together with setebos and prospero , to the same dynamic cluster , suggesting common origin . the diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde non-spherical moons of uranus ( in polar co-ordinates ) with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre .
