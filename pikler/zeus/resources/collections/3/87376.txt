Old Believers     in the russian orthodox church history , the old believers ( , read `` starovery '' or `` staroobryadtsy '' ) became separated after 1666-1667. they split from the hierarchy of the russian orthodox church as a protest against church reforms introduced by patriarch nikon . old believers continue liturgical practices which the russian orthodox church followed before the reform . russian-speakers refer to the schism itself as `` raskol '' ( раскол ) . this word comes from a russian word `` расколоться '' , that means `` to cleave apart '' ) . patriarch nikon ( 1605-1681 ; 1651-1658 as patriarch ) wanted to bring the russian orthodox church and the greek orthodox church closer together . for this reason , he changed a few rituals and texts in 1651. these changes were made to the russian rituals to be closer to the greek ones of nikon 's time . according to the old believers , nikon did this without the support of the clergy . and without a council . when the changes were done , people who still practised the old rites were persecuted .
