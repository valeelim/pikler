Sinti     sinti or sinta ( singular masc.=sinto ; sing . fem.=sintisa ) is the name of some communities of the nomadic people usually called `` gypsies '' in english . this includes communities known in german and dutch as `` zigeuner '' and in italian as `` zingari '' . they are closely related to , and are usually considered to be a subgroup of , the roma people . while the sinti were , until quite recently , chiefly nomadic , today only a small percentage of the group remains unsettled . in earlier times , they frequently lived on the outskirts of communities , generally in squalor . the sinti arrived in germany and austria in the middle ages , eventually splitting into two groups : `` eftavagarja '' ( `` the seven caravans '' ) and `` estraxarja '' ( `` from austria '' ) . these two groups then expanded , the eftavagarja into france , where they assimilated into the local romani groups ( manouches ) , and the estraxarja into italy and eastern europe , mainly what are now croatia , hungary , transylvania , the czech republic and slovakia , eventually taking various regional names .
