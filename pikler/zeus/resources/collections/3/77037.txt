Mafic     mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or igneous rock which is rich in magnesium and iron . the term is a portmanteau , made up from `` magnesium '' and `` ferric '' . mafic minerals are usually dark in color and have a specific gravity greater than 3. common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine , pyroxene , amphibole , biotite and other micas , augite and the calcium-rich plagioclase feldspars . common mafic rocks include basalt and gabbro . in terms of chemistry , mafic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the so-called felsic rocks . the term roughly corresponds to the older `` basic '' rock class . mafic lava , before cooling , has a lower viscosity than felsic lava due to its lower silica content . water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava , so eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic lava eruptions . most mafic lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes , like hawaii . other pages . - list of minerals
