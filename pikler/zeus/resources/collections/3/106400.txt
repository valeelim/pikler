Endospore     endospores are structures made by bacteria for survival purposes . bacteria turn to endosporea when they undergo stress , such as an increase in heat or lack of nutrients . this process is known as sporulation . endospores are small , rounded , resting cells that form inside bacteria when conditions become unbearable . they have a tough coating which makes it resistant to radiation ( like x-rays and uv light ) , chemicals , heat , salt concentration and extreme ph . it is not fully understood what causes it to be so resistant , but scientists attribute this resistance to calcium dipicolinate found in endospores . a bacterial cell will make an endospore when it is low on food so it can survive until there is more food available in the environment . an endospore will actually contain all of the important parts of the bacterial cell , such as its dna . only two genera of bacteria can undergo sporulation to form endospores . they are the `` bacillus '' and `` clostridium '' species . bacteria that can form endospores but are not in the endospore state are known to be in their vegetative state .
