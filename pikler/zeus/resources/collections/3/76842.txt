Microphone     a microphone , sometimes referred to as a mike or mic ( both ipa pronunciation : ) , converts sound into an electrical signal . microphones are used in many applications such as telephones , tape recorders , hearing aids , motion picture production , live and recorded audio engineering , in radio and television broadcasting and in computers for recording voice . sound passes through the air in waves , and as was said above , the microphone turns the sound wave into an electrical wave . different kinds of microphones will turn the sound waves into electricity in different ways . - carbon button - this is the first kind to become commonplace , being used in most 20th century telephones . sound waves , by compressing and decompressing a piece of carbon , change the amount of electric current flowing in the wire , thus creating electrical waves . this kind became rarer late in the century , due in part to lack of high fidelity . - dynamic - this uses a round plastic or rubber disk connected to a wire coil in order to turn sound into electricity . the sound wave hits the disk which vibrates as a result . this vibration moves the coil back and forth near a magnet very quickly in order to create an electrical current . the dynamic microphone is the exact opposite of a speaker which uses an electrical current to move the coil , which moves the disk . then the disk makes sound .
