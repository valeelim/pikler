Venus of Berekhat Ram     the venus of berekhat ram is a stone that was found on the golan heights in 1981. scientists have proposed to classify it as a venus figurine , because there are traces it was worked on with a stone tool . the things that have been worked can clearly be told apart from the natural stone . it is therefore agreed that the pebble has been modified by human action , even though it bears little resemblance to the much later `` venus figurines '' of about 30.000 years ago .
