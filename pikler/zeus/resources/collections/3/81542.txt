Pardon     a pardon is a decision that absolves a convicted person of a criminal conviction . a pardon may be `` full '' or `` partial '' : - a full pardon removes all of the consequences of conviction . - a partial pardon does not fully absolve a person of the conviction . for example , a partial pardon may not set aside a finding of guilt , or may not fully restore the rights of the person who received the pardon . pardons are sometimes given to people who are wrongly convicted . in that case , the person is cleared of that conviction , as if never convicted . the practice varies greatly between countries . in the united states a pardon for a federal conviction may be granted by the president , while pardons for state convictions may be granted by state governors .
