Richard III (play)    richard iii ( play ) richard iii is a history play written by william shakespeare . it is one of shakespeare 's most famous and popular plays . shakespeare probably wrote `` richard iii '' around the year 1593. the play was first printed in a book in 1597. like other history plays written by shakespeare , `` richard iii '' is about people and events from earlier in english history . the real richard iii was king of england from 1483 to 1485. shakespeare used the history books of his own time to create his play , though many modern experts do not think those early histories , or shakespeare 's play , are accurate and free of bias . `` richard iii '' is different from many plays , because its leading character is a villain , not a hero . in his play , shakespeare shows the king as a cruel tyrant who does many evil acts , before he is defeated in battle and killed by henry tudor . tudor then becomes henry vii of england , the next english king and the first of the tudor dynasty . shakespeare lived and wrote before modern ideas of freedom of speech and freedom of the press had become accepted . the english government of shakespeare 's day practiced censorship of books and plays . elizabeth i of england , who was queen from 1558 to 1603 , was the granddaughter of henry vii and the last tudor ruler . her government saw richard iii as a villain and the man who replaced him , henry vii , as a hero , and censored any other point of view . if shakespeare had wanted to write a play with richard iii as a hero , he would not have been allowed to do so .
