Roger D. Kornberg     roger david kornberg ( born ) is an american biochemist and nobel prize winner . kornberg got the nobel prize in chemistry in 2006 for studying eukaryote transcription ( the copying of information from dna to rna ) . kornberg is a professor of structural biology at stanford university school of medicine . his father , arthur kornberg , was also a professor at stanford university , and got the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1959. kornberg was born in st. louis , missouri to a jewish family . he was the first of three children born to arthur kornberg and his wife , sylvy . the parents worked together as biochemists . roger kornberg earned his bachelors degree from harvard university in 1967 and his phd from stanford university in 1972. he then became a fellow at the laboratory of molecular biology at the university of cambridge , england . all heredity is controlled by genes . for the cells to make use of the information in the genes , a copy of part of the gene must be made . the copying is called transcription . transcription makes an rna copy of part of the dna . the rna is moved out of the cell nucleus , to ribosomes , where it does its work . this is called messenger rna and it gives the amino acid sequence for protein production . this second process is called translation . it works in all eukaryotes , including all plants and animals .
