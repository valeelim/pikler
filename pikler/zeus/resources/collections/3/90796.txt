Speed of sound     the speed of sound is per hour or per second in dry air in room temperature . sound moves faster through liquids and solids than air , since liquids and solids can be pushed together more . sound can not travel through a vacuum , which is a space without any air or matter . the speed of sound is affected by temperature . it travels slower at low temperatures , for example in the stratosphere . you can calculate the speed of sound like this : formula_1 where : formula_2 is the ratio of specific heats ( 1.4 for air ) r is the gas constant ( formula_3 for air ) t is temperature ( in kelvins ) the speed of sound is also known as mach 1. things that go faster are supersonic . other websites . - calculate the speed of sound in air and the temperature - speed of sound - temperature matters , not air pressure
