Hexadecimal numeral system     the hexadecimal numeral system , also known as just hex , is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols ( base 16 ) . the standard numeral system is called decimal ( base 10 ) and uses ten symbols : 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and includes six extra symbols . there are no symbols that mean ten , or eleven etc . so these symbols are letters taken from the english alphabet : a , b , c , d , e and f. hexadecimal a = decimal 10 , and hexadecimal f = decimal 15. humans mostly use the decimal system . this is probably because humans have ten fingers ( ten digits ) . computers however , only have on and off , called a binary digit ( or bit , for short ) . a binary number is just a string of zeros and ones : 11011011 , for example . for convenience , engineers working with computers tend to group bits together . in earlier days , such as the 1960 's , they would group 3 bits at a time ( much like large decimal numbers are grouped in threes , like the number 123,456,789 ) . three bits , each being on or off , can represent the eight numbers from 0 to 7 : 000 = 0 ; 001 = 1 ; 010 = 2 ; 011 = 3 ; 100 = 4 ; 101 = 5 ; 110 = 6 and 111 = 7. this is called octal .
