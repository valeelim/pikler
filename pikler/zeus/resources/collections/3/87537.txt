Social democracy     social democracy is an ideology that has the same values as socialism , but in a different way . the ideology , named from democracy where people have a say in government actions , supports a competitive economy with money while also helping people whose jobs do n't pay a lot . this makes it easier for people to support themselves in society by having more protection if they lose their job with an emphasis on equal rights for everyone , and there is also plenty of either government ownership or regulation of various industries that make companies play by the government 's rules . this way of governing is appreciated by people living in countries who have to battle the cold more than others , like the northern nordic countries of sweden , denmark , finland , norway , and iceland . the ideology 's movement has seen some interest in other countries whose systems do not work this way , because it has worked well for those who have it . despite a common belief that social democracy is socialist by principle , its policies keep capitalism in place . but the government has a focus on keynesian economics , where the government should step in and help people without jobs . in social democracy entrepreneurs own the industries just like they would in a standard capitalist economy . in socialism the workers own them instead which is very different .
