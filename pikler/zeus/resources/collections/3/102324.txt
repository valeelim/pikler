Bolas     bolas ( from spanish `` bola '' , `` ball '' , also known as `` boleadoras '' ) are a throwing weapon made of weights on the ends of interconnected cords , designed to capture animals by their legs . they are used by the gauchos in south america today , but have been found in excavations of pre-hispanic settlements , especially in patagonia , where indigenous peoples used them to catch guanaco and Ã±andu . gauchos use boleadoras to capture running cattle or game . the thrower gives the balls momentum by swinging them and then releases the boleadoras . the weapon is usually used to entangle the animal 's legs , but when thrown with enough force might even break the bone . there is no uniform design ; most bolas have two or three balls , but there are versions of up to 8 or 9 balls . some bolas have balls of equal weight , others vary the knot and cord . gauchos use bolas made of leather cords with wooden balls or small leather sacks full of stones in the ends of the cords . bolas can be named depending on the amount of weights used :
