Saturn's Gallic group of satellites    saturn 's gallic group of satellites the gallic group is a dynamical grouping of the prograde irregular satellites of saturn following similar orbits . their semi-major axes range between 16 and 19 gm , their inclinations between 35° and 40° , and their eccentricities around 0.53. the international astronomical union ( iau ) reserves names taken from gallic mythology for these moons . similar mean orbital elements led the discoverers to postulate a common origin for the group in a break up of a larger body . the diagram illustrates the gallic group in relation to other irregular satellites of saturn . the eccentricity of the orbits is represented by the yellow segments ( extending from the pericentre to the apocentre ) with the inclination represented on y axis . the four members of the group are ( in order of increasing distance from saturn ) : - albiorix - bebhionn - erriapo - tarvos the group was later found to be physically homogenous , all satellites displaying `` light-red '' colour ( colour indices b − v = 0.91 and v − r = 0.48 )
