Co-operative Party     the co-operative party is a small socialist political party , in the united kingdom . its candidates must be members of the labour party as well , and stand as `` labour and co-operative party '' candidates . it is the political part of the wider british co-operative movement , and all members of the party must be members of a co-operative business . those who want to stand for election must also be members of the labour party . most of the party â€™ s money is from grants made by the retail co-operative societies , and from the fee charged for managing the political affairs of co-operatives uk , formerly known as the co-operative union . local parties are not based on constituencies , but around a major local retail society , which gives most of the money a local party council has . the party council organises local branches to organise local activity and liaise with constituency labour parties . some parties exist without society support , known as voluntary parties . at first the co-operative party was mostly concerned with the problems of the co-op movement . since the 1930s it has become a more mainstream political , but it still wants better recognition and protection for co-operative business , the social economy , and to advance support for co-operatives and co-operation across europe and the developing world . the party also stands for a sustainable economy and society .
