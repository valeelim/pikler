Solenoid     a solenoid is a 3 dimensional structure of wire . when this wire is wrapped around a metallic block in a coil and electricity is passed through it , it has some special magnetic properties . electromagnetic induction makes it an electromagnet that can be switched on or off . the side in which the current appears to be passing clockwise , is the south pole , and the side in which the current seems to be passing anticlockwise is the northern pole . the solenoid works just like a bar magnet , and therefore has many uses . this principle is used to create valves , among other things . where the solenoid operates an electric switch , it is a relay . pinball machines , vehicles and traditional door bells use solenoids .
