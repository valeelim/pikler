Io (moon)    io ( moon ) io is a moon of the planet jupiter . it is jupiter 's third biggest moon with a diameter of 3642 km , being slightly bigger than earth 's moon . io has about 400 active volcanos . io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system . volcanoes erupt massive volumes of silicate lava , sulphur and sulphur dioxide , constantly changing io 's appearance . this new basemap of jupiter 's moon io was produced by combining the best images from both the voyager 1 and galileo missions . although the subjovian hemisphere of io was poorly seen by galileo , superbly detailed voyager 1 images cover longitudes from 240 w to 40 w and the nearby southern latitudes . in the same way that the moon always has the same side facing earth , io always has the same side facing jupiter . the movie shows two sped-up rotations of io ( a single rotation really takes 1.77 days ) , and begins with a view of the jupiter-facing hemisphere . with rotation in an easterly direction , after two seconds the volcano prometheus ( on the equator ) comes into view . the massive red deposit around pele ( seconds 5-10 ) is the most distinctive expression of volcanic activity on io , and just to the north-west is the horse shoe-shaped loki patera , the most powerful volcano on io .
