New York Philharmonic     the new york philharmonic is the oldest symphony orchestra in the united states . it performs most of its concerts at the avery fisher hall in new york . the orchestra started in 1842. at that time it was called the philharmonic society . at its first concert the orchestra played a very long programme which included beethoven ’ s `` symphony no . 5 '' conducted by ureli corelli hill . the musicians worked as a cooperative or `` communistic '' society . this meant that the musicians themselves made up the rules about how the orchestra should be run : who would become a member , which music would be performed , and who would conduct . at the end of each season they divided any money the orchestra had earned amongst themselves . the orchestra were a great success , but they needed a new concert hall . they gave a fund-raising concert which included beethoven 's `` symphony no . 9 '' . it was the first time it had ever been played in america . the concert took place in castle garden on the southern tip of manhattan . there were about 400 performers in the orchestra and choir . the words that the choir sings were translated into english . it was the first time this work had been sung in english anywhere in the world . however , the tickets cost a lot of money : us $ 2.00 each , so not so many people came . it was some time before the orchestra got their concert hall . many people thought beethoven 's 9th symphony was a strange piece of music because the choir only sing in the last movement which is called `` ode to joy '' . in 1865 theodore eisfeld conducted the orchestra ’ s memorial concert for the recently assassinated abraham lincoln , but the last movement was not performed because it was thought that the `` ode to joy '' was not suitable for the sad occasion .
