Bagpipes     the bagpipes are a musical instrument . they are sometimes just called `` pipes '' . they have a bag that holds air . the player keeps the bag full of air by blowing into it with a tube or pumping it with a bellows . to make music , the bag is pressed and the air comes out through a kind of flute or `` chanter '' . there are usually one or more other tubes coming from the bag that make sounds whenever the bag is squeezed , called `` drones '' . each drone normally plays a different note , and stays on the same note the whole time it is playing , to play a harmony with the `` chanter '' . the sounds are made by a single or , more commonly , double reed which vibrates when air is blown over it . scotland is traditionally linked to the bagpipes , and many pipe tunes come from there . many , many other places , however , also have different types of bagpipes : over all of europe , some of north africa , and into the middle east . the scottish pipes , the great pipe , or piob-mohr , first had only one drone pipe . the second pipe was added in the mid 1500s and the third pipe was added in the 1700s .
