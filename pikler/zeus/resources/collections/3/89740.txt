Orlande de Lassus     orlande de lassus ( whose name is also spelt orlandus lassus , orlando di lasso , roland de lassus , or roland delattre ) ( born mons , hainaut , probably in 1532 ; died munich , 14 june , 1594 ) was a franco-flemish composer who lived in the last part of the renaissance . lassus and palestrina are the two most famous composers of that time who were writing church music in a polyphonic style . he was born in mons in the province of hainaut in the low countries which is mostly what is today the south part of the netherlands and belgium . we know very little about his childhood . there is a story that , when he was a choirboy , he was abducted three times by another church who wanted him to sing in their choir because he had a beautiful voice . there is no proof that this story is true.. at the age of twelve he left his country and went to mantua , sicily , and later to milan in italy and then to naples where he worked until the early 1550s . next he moved to rome , where he worked for the grand duke of tuscany , who had a large household there . in 1553 , he became `` maestro di cappella '' of the basilica di san giovanni in laterano in rome . this was an excellent job for a man who was only 21 years old . however , he only stayed there a year . later , in 1555 , palestrina took that job . lassus left rome to go home to the low countries to see his parents who were ill , but by the time he got home they were both dead .
