Aikido     aikido is based on ueshiba 's philosophy , martial arts training and religious beliefs . the word `` aikido '' is often translated as `` the way of unifying ( with ) life energy '' or as `` the way of harmonious spirit . '' ueshiba wanted to create an art where people could defend themselves without harming their attacker by using the attackers `` ki '' against them . he wanted each practitioner of aikido to develop both physically and spiritually . aikido is performed by blending with the way the attacker moves , using the force of the attack rather than coming against it . this is achieved by using the attackers `` ki '' against them . this takes very little physical strength , as the `` aikidōka '' ( person who does aikido ) uses the force of the attacker 's own momentum using stepping and turning movements . the techniques are completed with many different throws or joint locks which can be combined with different defenses . aikido is one of many grappling arts . aikido is based on the martial art of daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu , but began to separate from it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshiba 's involvement with the ōmoto-kyō religion . ueshiba 's early students ' records use the name `` aiki-jūjutsu '' . many of ueshiba 's senior students have different approaches to aikido , depending on when they studied with him . today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles , with different groups placing importance on different things . however , they all share techniques learned from ueshiba and most have concern for the safety of the attacker .
