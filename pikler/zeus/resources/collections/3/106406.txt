Gel electrophoresis     gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate mixtures like dna and proteins . the separation is based on how positively or how negatively charged a molecule is , and its size . gel electrophoresis uses a gel ( like gelatin ) and an electric field is put through the gel . the word electrophoresis comes from –electro , because an electric field is used , and –phoresis , which means movement . the gel is made up of large and branched molecules called polymers . the amount of branches in the gel determines how easily molecules can squeeze through , depending on their size . if there are a lot of branches , small molecules will be able to move through easily while big molecules will move through slowly or not at all . if there are few branches , both big and small molecules can move through more easily . if a large molecule has a big charge , its attraction to the opposite charge is also large . but , since the molecule is large , it will have a difficult time moving through the thick gel . in gel electrophoresis , large molecules are going to move slower .
