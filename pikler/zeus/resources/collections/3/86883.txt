Legitimacy     the word legitimacy means something which is good and right . why the thing is right may be because it follows the law , a religion says it is right , or maybe it is naturally right . people may not agree about what is right , and because of this they may not agree what `` legitimacy '' is and what is `` legitimate '' . there are two different uses of the word `` legitimacy '' when a government is accepted by many people it is considered to have `` legitimacy '' . in the past , some different reasons were used to make people accept a government . in the zhou dynasty of old china the rulers said they were given the `` mandate of heaven '' which means that the ruler was chosen by god . this is similar to the divine right of kings doctrine in europe , where kings would say they were chosen by god . in the time of the enlightenment , john locke wrote that legitimacy came from the agreement of the people under the government . in western thinking , this has become the accepted meaning . not all the people must agree , only most of the people . most of the people must agree that the government is the best way to make laws and rule , if the government has legitimacy .
