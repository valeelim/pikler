Gharial     the gharial ( `` gavialis gangeticus '' ) , sometimes called the indian gharial or gavial , is one of two surviving members of the family gavialidae . they are a group of crocodile-like reptiles with long , narrow jaws . the gharial is the second-longest of all living crocodilians : a large male can be nearly six meters in length . only saltwater crocodiles and the nile crocodile can grow larger . it is the national reptile of bangladesh . the fossil history of the gavialoidea is quite well known . the earliest examples split from the other crocodilians in the late cretaceous . the feature of the group that is easiest to recognise is the very long , narrow snout . this is an adaptation to a diet of small fish . gharials have sacrificed the great mechanical strength of the robust skull and jaw that most crocodiles and alligators have . for this reason , and they can not prey on large creatures . but they also have reduced weight and water resistance of their lighter skull and very narrow jaw . this gives gharials the ability to catch rapidly moving fish . they catch them with a side-to-side snapping motion .
