Karyotype     a karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryote cell . the term is also used of the complete set of chromosomes in a species , or an individual organism . it describes the number of chromosomes , and what they look like under a light microscope . attention is paid to their length , the position of the centromeres , any differences between the sex chromosomes , and any other physical characteristics . the preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics ( cytology and genetics ) . the basic number of chromosomes in the somatic ( body ) cells of an individual or a species is called the `` somatic number '' and is designated `` 2n '' . thus , in humans 2n = 46. in the sex cells the chromosome number is `` n '' ( humans : n = 23 ) . so , in normal diploid organisms , chromosomes are present in two copies . there may , or may not , be sex chromosomes . polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies . the study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as `` karyology '' .
