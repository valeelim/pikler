Bohemianism     the word bohemian was first used in paris to mean a gypsy because many people thought that gypsies came from bohemia . the word was then used in the late 19th century ( 1800s ) for poor painters , writers , musicians and actors who often travelled to paris from other towns and tried to earn money . paris was a famous town for painters , writers , and musicians to gather , to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city . many of them lived at montmartre , not far from the `` moulin rouge '' . one of the most famous painters to live in montmartre was henri toulouse-lautrec . he loved to paint the can-can dancers and prostitutes . he did many posters to advertise the nightclubs . the posters are now famous works of art . in the 20th century the word `` bohemian '' spread to other countries and was used to describe the lives of many different artists of different sorts . the sort of behaviour that was thought of as `` bohemian '' included whether a person had a regular job , how they dressed , their political views , their religious views , their sexual behaviour and the entertainment they liked .
