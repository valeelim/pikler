Finnix     finnix is a debian based live cd linux distribution , developed by ryan finnie and intended for system administrators for tasks such as filesystem recovery , network monitoring and os installation . finnix is a small linux distribution , with an iso download size of approximately 100 mib . finnix was created in 1999 , making it one of the oldest linux distributions with the intent of being run completely from a bootable cd ( the other live cd around at the time was the linuxcare bootable business card cd , first released in 1999 ) . finnix 0.01 was based on red hat linux 6.1 , and was created to help with administration and recovery of other linux workstations around finnie 's office.. on 23 october 2005 , finnix 86.0 was released . earlier unreleased versions ( 84 , and 85.0 through 85.3 ) were `` knoppix remasters '' , with support for linux lvm and dm-crypt being the main reason for creation . however , 86.0 was a departure from knoppix , and was derived directly from the debian `` testing '' tree . finnix is released as a small bootable cd iso . a user can download the iso , burn the image to cd , and boot into a text mode linux environment . finnix requires at least 32mib ram to run properly , but can use more if present . most hardware devices are detected and dealt with automatically , such as hard drives , network cards and usb devices . a user can modify files nearly anywhere on the running cd via unionfs , a filesystem that can stack a read-write filesystem ( in this case , a dynamic ramdisk ) on top of a read-only filesystem ( the cd media ) . any changes made during the finnix session are transparently written to ram and discarded upon shutdown . in addition , finnix uses squashfs to keep distribution size low .
