Carnosaur     carnosaurs are a subgroup of the theropod dinosaurs . they are the clade carnosauria . the term was once used very widely , but is now defined more narrowly . it is called by some authorities the allosauroidea . the group includes some of the main carnivores of the jurassic and cretaceous periods , such as `` allosaurus '' , `` carcharodontosaurus '' and `` neovenator '' . modern cladistic analysis defines carnosauria ( or allosauroidea ) as those tetanurans which share a more recent common ancestor with `` allosaurus '' than with modern birds . carnosaurs are characterized by several features . some features must have been adaptations to their large size , such as their open skull , made of struts rather than solid bone . they had large eyes and a long , narrow skull . the femur ( `` thigh bone '' ) is usually larger than the tibia ( `` shin bone '' ) . this suggests close-to action was controlled by sight . the legs are adapted for running , but not extremely so . they had strong arms , probably used to wrestle prey as the teeth bit in . the structure of an `` allosaurus '' suggests a strongly-built general all-round predator . this is a different from a tyrannosaur like `` albertosaurus '' , which was better adapted for running on open ground . tyrannosaurs , with their small two-fingered hands , would use their heads for killing prey , and for head-butting rivals .
