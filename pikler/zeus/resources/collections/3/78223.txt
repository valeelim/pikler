Tunicate     tunicates ( sea squirts or urochordata ) are a subphylum of the chordates . they are filter feeders , living mainly from plankton . the adults are sessile , stuck to rocks . they are called tunicates because the adult form is covered by a leathery tunic . this tunic supports and protects the animal . many of them are colonial or semi-colonial in their adult stage . they are quite a large group , containing about 3,000 species . the adults live mostly on the sea floor , in the littoral zone . the sea squirt has two openings in its small body . one opening , called the `` oral siphon '' , sucks water into the animal ; the other opening , called the `` atrial siphon '' , squirts water out of the animal . inside is a little basket-like sieve which traps food : so these sea squirts are filter feeders . the sea squirt can close the holes in its siphons , like a drawstring can close the opening in a bag . when in its larval state , it looks like a tadpole and is sometimes called a `` tadpole larva '' . like many sea creatures , a sea squirt larva looks very different from an adult sea squirt . the larva swims for a short time and then attaches itself to something on the sea floor , like a rock , transforming into its adult form . it usually stays in one place for the rest of its life .
