Amplitude modulation     amplitude modulation , usually shortened to am , is a simple way to send a radio signal . the signal can travel long distances , and appear in faraway places , because of the earth 's ionosphere . amplitude is the height of a wave . a carrier wave is modulated ( changed ) by adding audio . the combined signal is transmitted over a frequency . am signals can be received by a crystal-powered radio set , that needs no batteries or electrical power source . many early radios were homemade , and used earphones . am signals are mostly sent out on medium wave and shortwave frequencies . they do not carry high fidelity sound , but the sound is good enough to hear most things . analog signals can fade in and out , or have interference from power lines and power stations . sunspot activity can also weaken signals . in the early years of commercial broadcasting in the 1920s , medium wave am ( from 540 to 1600 kilocycles ) was the only kind of radio widely used . radio programs were much like today 's television programming , with news , sports , drama , music , comedy , and other entertainment .
