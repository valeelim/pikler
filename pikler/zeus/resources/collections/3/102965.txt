Continental divide     a continental divide is a line of raised terrain that creates a border between two watersheds . water falling on one side of the line travels to one ocean , and water on the other side travels to another , perhaps on the other side of the continent . because the exact border between bodies of water is usually not very easy to see , the continental divide is not always clear . the international hydrographic organization 's publication `` limits of oceans and seas '' describes the exact boundaries of oceans , but it is not recognized around the world . a complication is that some rivers empty into deserts or inland seas , and so do not end up in the ocean .
