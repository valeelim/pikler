Digital divide     digital divide is the gap between parts of the world where access to technology is very different . there are technologies like internet , mobile phones , computers and wi-fi in some parts of the world , and in other parts there are not . it is the difference of people that can access the internet , and the people that can not . a digital divide can be born for many reasons like socioeconomic problems ( few people are rich and lots are poor ) , racial problems ( there is a majority or a minority that control the other ) , or geographical problems ( in the cities there are technologies but there are not in rural areas ) . countries on the rich side of the divide include canada , the united states , japan , south korea , europe and australasia . they have big internet connection developments , and most people can afford computers and other technology . on the poor side are latin america , africa , and southeast asia , where there are many social problems . technology has a long way to go before getting interest in those countries , because of problems like the price of technology and the fact that sometimes there are not any resources to help .
