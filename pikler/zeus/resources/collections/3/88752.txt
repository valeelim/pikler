Pacific hurricane     a pacific hurricane is a tropical cyclone that forms in the northeastern part of the pacific ocean . for organizational purposes , the pacific ocean is divided into three parts : the eastern ( north america to 140°w ) , central ( 140°w to the international date line ) , and western ( west of the date line ) . a pacific hurricane , then , is a tropical cyclone in the northern pacific ocean east of the date line . tropical cyclones that form in the western north pacific are called typhoons . this separation between the two basins is convenient , however , as tropical cyclones rarely form in the central north pacific and few ever cross the dateline . related pages . - tropical cyclone - atlantic hurricane
