Surveying     surveying is the technique and science of accurately finding out the position of points and the distances and angles between them . these points are usually , but not always , associated with positions on the surface of the earth . they are often used to make land maps and boundaries for ownership of land . a person who does the surveying is called a surveyor . in order to find the information they need , surveyors use geometry , engineering , trigonometry , mathematics , physics , and law . surveying has been very important in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history ( ca . 5000 years ago ) and it is a requirement planning of nearly every form of construction . its most common uses are in the fields of transport , building and construction , communications , mapping , and the making of legal boundaries for land ownership . surveying has existed throughout much of our history . in ancient egypt , when the nile river overflowed its banks and washed out farm boundaries , the boundaries were recreated by surveyors using simple geometry . the construction of many of the pyramids , including the great pyramids of giza , built c. 2700 bc , show us that the egyptians ' have always used surveying very efficiently .
