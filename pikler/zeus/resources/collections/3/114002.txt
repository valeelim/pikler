Louise Farrenc     louise farrenc ( born paris , 31 may 1804 ; died 15 september 1875 ) was a french composer , virtuoso pianist and teacher . she was very well-known during her lifetime , but her best compositions are not very well known . this is because the way to become a famous composer in france in the 19th century was by writing operas , but farrenc never wrote operas . her best compositions are chamber music . her name when she was born was jeanne-louise dumont . her father was a successful sculptor . she was very young when she started to learn the piano . her teacher had been a pupil of muzio clementi . soon she was having piano lessons with famous teachers such as ignaz moscheles and johann nepomuk hummel . she loved composing , so her parents let her study composition with anton reicha at the paris conservatoire . at that time women were not allowed to go to composition classes at the conservatoire , so she probably had her lessons privately . she met a flautist ( flute player ) called aristide farrenc . he was ten years older than she was . they often performed together and they married in 1821. she stopped her studies and travelled with her husband around france giving concerts . he soon grew tired of the concert life and decided to open a publishing house in paris , which was called éditions farrenc . it became one of france ’ s most important music publishers for nearly 40 years .
