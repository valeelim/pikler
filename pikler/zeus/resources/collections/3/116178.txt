Regression analysis     regression analysis is a field of statistics . it is a tool to show the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a system . there are different ways to do this . better curve fitting usually needs more complex calculations . `` data modeling '' can be used without any knowledge of underlying processes that have generated the data ; in this case the model is an empirical model . moreover , in modelling , knowledge of the probability distribution of the errors is not required . `` regression analysis '' requires assumptions to be made regarding probability distribution of the errors . statistical tests are made on the basis of these assumptions . in regression analysis the term `` model '' embraces both the function used to model the data and the assumptions concerning probability distributions . regression can be used for prediction ( including forecasting of time-series data ) , inference , hypothesis testing , and modeling of causal relationships . these uses of regression rely heavily on the underlying assumptions being satisfied . regression analysis has been criticized as being misused for these purposes in many cases where the appropriate assumptions can not be verified to hold . one factor contributing to the misuse of regression is that it can take considerably more skill to critique a model than to fit a model .
