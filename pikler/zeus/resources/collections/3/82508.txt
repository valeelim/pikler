Layla     layla is a song by derek and the dominos . the song first appeared on the album `` layla and other assorted love songs '' . this song clocks in at 7 minutes and 4 seconds , and it is split into two sections . the first section has the unmistakable guitar riff , which has two parts to it . the first part is played on a brownie guitar by eric clapton . the next part that comes in is played on a gibson les paul by duane allman . clapton also sings the lead vocals . bobby whitlock sings the backup vocals , and he plays the keyboard . carl radle plays the bass , and jim gordon plays the drums . he plays the piano part in the second segment , and clapton and allman both play slide guitar during the piano exit part . bobby whitlock plays an acoustic guitar , which augments the piano . while led zeppelin 's `` stairway to heaven '' builds from a quiet introduction to a hard rock finale , `` layla '' does pretty much the opposite . this song was dedicated to pattie boyd , who was already married to george harrison . the lyrics have something to do with unrequited love . the song was also named after a fictional character in a movie .
