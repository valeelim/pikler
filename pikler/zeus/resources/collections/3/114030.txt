Live CD     a live cd , live dvd , or live distro is a special way of creating a computer operating system so that it is able to run without installing anything on the computer first . this special operating system is used when the computer is booting up , and runs all its programs off the object it is put on . the name of the operating system usually has something to do with the object , such as `` live cd '' for cds , `` live dvd '' for dvds , or `` live usb '' for usb flash drives . `` distro '' is short for distribution , and is used because different types of linux operating systems are called linux distributions , and linux distros were the first operating systems to be made into live cds . a `` live distro '' is used to refer to all different kinds of these special operating systems , instead of just the ones on a certain object . the word `` live '' is used to describe the special way that the operating system is set up so that it can run on a computer without needing to install anything first . the first linux-based live cd was yggdrasil linux ( it stopped being made in 1995 ) , but it did not work well because back then cd drives could not read cds fast enough . in 2003 , a live cd based on debian called knoppix was released . many people liked to use knoppix , both as an operating system , and as a way of fixing a computer . many more people have started using live cds since then , because of programs like linux live scripts and remastersys which make it very easy to make your own personalized live cd .
