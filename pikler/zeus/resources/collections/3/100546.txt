Battle of Stalingrad     the battle of stalingrad was fought during the second world war between nazi germany and the soviet union . they were fighting for control of the city of stalingrad . the battle was fought between 17 july 1942 and 2 february 1943. it was one of the most important battles of the war because it marked the end of germany 's advances . hitler even blamed his defeat partly on stalingrad . the battle of stalingrad has often been recorded as an example of how brutal a war can be . it is reported that , due to limited supplies , soldiers and civilians had to resort to eating rats , possibly even cannibalism . stalingrad , now volgograd , was a city on the volga river . it was an important industrial city . if the germans won the battle then they would control the caucasus area of russia , and its oil . hitler also wanted to capture stalingrad because it was named after josef stalin , the leader of the soviet union , thus it would embarrass him . in june 1942 , adolf hitler launched an attack in southern russia . by the end of july the german army had reached stalingrad . with bombs and fire the german air force , the luftwaffe , turned the city into ruins . however , the rubble made hiding places from which russian snipers could attack the germans . hitler and stalin sent in large numbers of soldiers . they both ordered that there was to be no retreat . those that deserted or retreated would be shot on the spot for treason .
