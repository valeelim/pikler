Ichthyosaurus     ichthyosaurus was an extinct marine reptile from the lower jurassic . it was the first member of the order ichthyosauria to be discovered . the first complete skeleton was discovered in the early 19th century ( 1810/11 ) by mary anning in the dorset jurassic coast . many more specimens were found in europe , especially from the limestone quarries in holzmaden , southern germany . ichthyosaurus lived from about 199 to 189 million years ago ( mya ) . this sleek animal could perhaps swim at speeds up to 25 mph ( 40 kph ) . `` ichthyosaurus '' bore live young . this we know from fossil evidence . it was thought at first that `` ichthyosaurus '' laid eggs on land , but fossil evidence shows that the females gave birth to live young . because they did , their life habit could be entirely aquatic . they were well-adapted to life as fully pelagic organisms because they never needed to come onto land . the babies were born tail first to prevent them from drowning in the water . hundreds of well-preserved , fossilised skeletons have been found in jurassic rock at holzmaden . some of the bones were still articulated . some fossils still had baby specimens inside them , indicating that `` ichthyosaurus '' was viviparous . similar finds in the related `` stenopterygius '' also show this .
