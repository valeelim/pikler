Viceroyalty of Perú     the viceroyalty of peru ( in spanish , `` virreinato del perú '' ) was a spanish colonial administrative district that was created in 1542 and originally contained most of spanish-ruled south america . it was governed from the capital of lima . in 1542 , the spanish created the viceroyalty of new castilla , that shortly afterwards would be called the viceroyalty of peru . in 1544 , holy roman emperor charles v ( king charles i of spain ) named `` blasco núñez vela '' peru 's first viceroy , but the viceroyalty was not organized until the arrival of viceroy francisco de toledo in 1572. francisco de toledo , `` one of the great administrators of human times '' , established the inquisition and created laws that applied to both indians and spanish alike . so he broke the power of the encomenderos and reduced the old system of forced native labor . he improved the safety in the viceroyalty with fortifications , bridges and `` la armada del mar del sur '' ( the southern fleet ) against the pirates . the amazon basin and some large regions nearby had been considered spanish territory since the treaty of tordesillas . but this treaty meant not much during the time spain controlled portugal ( 1580 - 1640 ) .
