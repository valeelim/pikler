Federal government of the United States     the federal government of the united states has three branches of government : the legislature , executive , and judiciary , as established in the united states constitution . when the founding fathers wrote the constitution , they wanted to make sure that their new government would not have any of the problems that the colonial british government did . for example , they did not want there to be any person in the government who had complete power and could do whatever he wanted , like a king . they also did not want any part of the government to get so powerful that nobody could control it . because of this , they split the government 's power into three different branches . each branch has ways of balancing out the power of another branch if it gets too powerful . this is called the system of checks and balances . the executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law . members of the u.s. electoral college elect a president , who is the leader of the executive branch . the president is also the leader of the armed forces .
