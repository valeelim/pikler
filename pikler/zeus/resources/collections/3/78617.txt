Manor house     a manor house or fortified manor-house is a country house , which has historically formed the centre of a manor ( see manorialism ) . the term is sometimes used for relatively small country houses which belonged to gentry families , as well as to grand stately homes , particularly as a technical term for minor late medieval castles more intended for show than for defence . in general terms , the manor house was the house of a feudal lord of a manor , which he occupied only on occasional visits if he held many manors . although not built with strong fortifications as castles were , many manor houses were partly fortified : they were enclosed within walls or ditches . often the farm buildings were within these walls as well . many of manor houses had small gatehouses and watchtowers . the main feature of the manor house was its great hall . by the beginning of the 16th century , manor houses as well as small castles began to acquire the character and amenities of the residences of country gentlemen . this late 16th century transformation produced many of the smaller renaissance ch√¢teaux of france and the many country mansions of the elizabethan and jacobean styles in england .
