Ageing     ageing ( or `` aging '' ) is the changes that happen in an individual over time . in humans , ageing is several physical and psychological changes . senescence is the biological process which leads to ageing . there have been many attempts to answer the question : why do animals ( especially humans ) age ? in one way , ageing begins at birth , because cell division and growth is fastest then , and gradually slows down as time goes on . in another way , ageing starts when the likelihood of death increases . actuarial tables show the likelihood of death at each stage of life . these tables are used by insurance companies to assess the rates of insurance on life policies and pensions . it turns out that we are least likely to die when we are young adults . for girls this is as early as 14. the reason suggested by biologists ( such as peter medawar and george c. williams ) is that this is the time most significant for reproduction , or was in mankind 's past . the assumption is that the peak age of reproduction in mankind 's history was lower than today . a gene can be expressed at various stages of life . any allele of a gene which interfered with reproduction would have less chance of passing on to the next generation . the number of such genes in the population would automatically be reduced . thus natural selection would virtually eliminate any inherited effect which reduced fertility .
