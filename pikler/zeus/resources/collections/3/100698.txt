Khan (title)    khan ( title ) khan ( sometimes spelled as `` xan '' , `` han '' , `` ke-han '' , , ) is an originally central asian title for a sovereign or military ruler . it was used by the mongols who brought it to all over asia . it now has many equivalent meanings such as commander , leader , or ruler . presently , khans exist mostly in south asia , central asia and iran . the female alternatives are khatun and khanum . a khan controls a khanate ( sometimes spelled `` chanat '' ) . whenever appropriate as ruler of a monarchy , `` khan '' is also translated as king or prince . ( but that translation is not quite correct . ) originally khans only headed relatively minor tribes . the title `` khan '' became well known when the tribal mongol temüjin proved himself a military genius by creating the mongol empire , the greatest land empire the world ever saw , which he ruled as genghis khan . his title was khagan 'khan of khans ' , see below , but is often 'shortened ' to khan ( rather like the persian `` shahanshah '' – also meaning 'king of kings ' – is usually called shah , equally incorrect , in most western languages ) or described as 'great khan ' ( like the ottoman padishah being called 'great sultan ' ) .
