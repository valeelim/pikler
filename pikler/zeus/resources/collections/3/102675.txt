English Renaissance drama     english renaissance drama is sometimes called elizabethan drama , since its most important developments started when elizabeth i was queen of england from 1558 to 1603. but this name is not very accurate ; the drama continued after elizabeth 's death , into the reigns of king james i ( 1603–1625 ) and his son king charles i ( 1625–1649 ) . shakespeare , for example , started writing plays in the later years of elizabeth 's reign , but continued into the reign of james . when writing about plays from james 's reign , scholars and critics sometimes use the term jacobean drama ; plays from charles i 's reign are called caroline drama . ( these names come from the latin forms of the two kings ' names , `` jacobus '' for james and `` carolus '' for charles . ) but for the subject as a whole , terms like english renaissance drama or theatre are more accurate . the year 1576 was a key date in this subject , since that is when the first permanent theatre building was built in london . it was called simply the theatre , because it was the only place of its kind in england at the time . before 1576 , plays were acted in public halls and large houses , and in inns and public squares and courtyards and other open spaces , by troops of actors that mostly travelled around the countryside between cities and towns . once the actors had a permanent place to act plays , they could develop their art without the constant need to travel . the theatre was followed by other theatres in the london area ; there were the curtain , the rose , the swan , the globe , and others too . more plays were written by more playwrights to fill these theatres .
