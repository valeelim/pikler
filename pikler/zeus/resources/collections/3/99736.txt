Hypersonic     in aerodynamics , hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic . the word hypersonic came from a word used in the 1970s , mach 5 , or 5 times the speed of sound . everything about the plane changes greatly when the airplane that is flying at those speeds reaches supersonic speeds . though the definition for hypersonic speeds is not very clear and is a subject of debate among scientists , they have come up with a possible definition . a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain things that can no longer be discounted in analysis . some of these things include : as the plane goes faster and mach numbers increase , the density behind the shock also goes up . this happens in concert with a decrease in volume behind the shock wave because of the conservation of mass theory . because of this , the shock layer ( the volume between the body and the shock wave ) is thin at high mach numbers . as a plane goes faster and mach numbers go up , the entropy change across the shock also goes up . this results in a strong entropy gradient and highly vortical flow that mixes with the boundary layer .
