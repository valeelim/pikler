Telnet     telnet is a common network protocol used on the internet and also inside a lan ( local network ) . it was developed in 1969 beginning with rfc 15 and is now defined as ietf std 8 , which is one of the first internet standards . however , due to its lack of security , telnet has been replaced with secure shell ( ssh ) on most servers . telnet is one of the simplest ways to exchange data between two computers . it allows two computers anywhere on a computer network , including the worldwide internet , to exchange text and other data in real time . it is still widely used for testing computer programs , and is simple enough that it is included on most computers today . but it allows many people to eavesdrop on the data exchange , which is why it has mostly been replaced by ssh .
