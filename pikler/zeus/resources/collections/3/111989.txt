WWE Brand Extension     the world wrestling federation/entertainment ( wwf/e ) brand extension was a draft first used in 2002 by wwe with the purpose of dividing wwe superstars into two brands , `` raw '' and `` smackdown ! '' . in 2006 `` ecw '' was added to the draft . after buying world championship wrestling ( wcw ) , its business opponent through the 1990s , in march 2001 , the world wrestling federation ( wwf ) wanted to find a way to split itself into two separate brands , because of the numbers of superstars that it had gotten as part of wcw 's purchase . on march 18 , 2002 , linda mcmahon announced the `` brand extension '' in which the company would be split into two distinct brands . in terms of storyline , ric flair had become co-owner of the wwf following survivor series 2001 where shane and stephanie mcmahon sold their stocks to flair in order to buy wcw and extreme championship wrestling ( ecw ) . vince mcmahon did not like having to share his creation with flair and looked for a way to stop their partnership . after entering a feud with the undertaker , flair sought a match with him at wrestlemania x8 . however , the wwf board of directors would only allow the match if flair were to give all control of the wwf to mcmahon . flair agreed , however , the board also reserved the right to review the ownership status of the wwf following wrestlemania . their decision was to split the entire wwf roster into two separate brands , with vince mcmahon in control of the smackdown ! brand and ric flair in control of the raw brand . a draft was started the following week on `` raw '' . each owner would get a total of thirty picks . the brand extension officially began on april 1 , 2002. by having two brands in place , the wwf was able to increase the number of live events held each year from 200 to 350 .
