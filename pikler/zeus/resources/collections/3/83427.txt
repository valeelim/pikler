Fortran     fortran is a programming language first created in the 1950s . it is still in use today . it is a procedural language mainly used for scientific computing and numerical analysis . the first fortran compiler was created in 1954-57 by a team at ibm led by john w. backus . this compiler was the first compiler for any high level language . the authors were worried that no one would use the language if programs written in it did not run nearly as fast as programs written in assembly language . so they made it an optimizing compiler . because of the heavy use by scientists doing numerical work the language grew in ways that encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that generated high quality ( fast ) code . there are many high performance compiler vendors . much work and research in compiler theory and design was caused by the need to generate good code for fortran programs . several revisions of the language have appeared , including the very well known fortran iv ( the same as fortran 66 ) , fortran 77 and fortran 90. the most recent formal standard for the language was published in 1997 and is known as fortran 95 .
