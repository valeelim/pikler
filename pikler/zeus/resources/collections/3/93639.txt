Respiratory system     the respiratory system , also called the gas exchange system , is the body getting rid of carbon dioxide and taking in oxygen . carbon dioxide , a waste product , goes out of the body . oxygen , which the body needs , comes in . the first step in this process is breathing in air , or inhaling . the taking in of air rich in oxygen into the body is called inhalation and giving out of air rich in carbon dioxide from the body is called exhalation . the second step is gas exchange in the lungs where oxygen is diffused into the blood and the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood . the third process is cellular respiration , which produces the chemical energy that the cells in the body need , and carbon dioxide . finally , the carbon dioxide from cellular respiration is breathed out of body from the lungs . breathing is the first step in respiration.for respiration to happen , the body needs a constant supply of oxygen , which is done by breathing . inhalation is the breathing in of air . to inhale , the lungs expand , decreasing the air pressure in the lungs . this is caused by the diaphragm ( a sheet of muscular tissue that separates the lungs from the abdomen ) and the muscles between the ribs contracting to expand the chest , which also expands the lungs . as the air pressure inside the lungs are lower when it has expanded , air from outside at higher pressure comes rushing into the area of low pressure in the lungs . air first passes through the nose and mouth , then through the larynx ( voice box ) , then down the trachea ( windpipe ) , and into the lungs and comes out
