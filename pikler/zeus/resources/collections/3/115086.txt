Bird flight     flight is a method of moving through the air . to do this , birds use wings with light , hollow bones and feathers on them . birds have a streamlined body shape , so that they slip through air more easily . birds can move by flapping their wings , or they can stay in the same place . this is called hovering , with rapid wing beats , as with the kestrel . birds that soar use very little energy for it : they use columns of rising hot air to lift them . they glide from the top of a warm air current , and then move on to another warm air current . that way birds like buzzards can fly all day while using little energy . birds like hawks and gannets dive on their prey . they get to a height , them fold their wings and dive head-first . the fundamentals of bird flight are similar to those of aircraft . lift force is produced by the action of air flow on the wing , which is an airfoil . the lift force occurs because the air has a lower pressure just above the wing and higher pressure below .
