Lake Zug     the lake zug ( german : `` zugersee '' ) is one of the lesser known swiss lakes , on the outskirts of the alps and north of lake lucerne . it is fed by the aa , which descends from the rigi and enters the south end of the lake . the lorze feeds the lake at the northern shore . for the most part , the lake is in the canton of zug , but the southern end is up to 10 km in the canton of schwyz , while the canton of lucerne stretches over a 2 km area by the immensee . at its northern end the shores are nearly level , while on the west shore the wooded promontory of buonas ( with its castles , old and new ) projects picturesquely into the waters . the principal place on the lake is the town of zug . three railways follow the shore of the lake , one from zürich via zug and arth-goldau to the st gotthard , one from lucerne via arth-goldau to the st gotthard and one from zürich via zug to lucerne . many fish ( including pike and carp of considerable weights ) are taken from the lake , which is especially famous for an endemic kind of trout ( `` salmo salvelinus '' , locally called `` rolheli '' ) . because of farming runoff , it is not one of switzerland 's cleanest lakes .
