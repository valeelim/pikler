Doppler radar     doppler radar uses the doppler effect to measure the speed ( radial velocity ) of targets . radial velocity is how fast the target is coming towards , or going away from , the radar . the doppler effect will shift the received frequency up or down , based on the radial velocity of a target in the beam . this gives a direct and highly accurate measurement of target velocity , but only the radial velocity . doppler radar by itself does n't measure the azimuthal velocity ( how fast it is going in other directions ) . doppler radars may be coherent pulsed , continuous wave , or frequency modulated .
