Eoraptor     eoraptor is one of the earliest known possible saurischian dinosaurs . it was a very small omnivore or carnivore which lived in the lower triassic , about 245 million years ago ( mya ) . it is the only one of the possible early dinosaurs which can be exactly dated by a layer of volcanic ash close beneath the fossil . `` eoraptor '' was a small , lightly-built archosaur that walked on two long legs . it was about 3 feet long ( 1 m ) ; it had light , hollow bones , a long head with dozens of small , sharp teeth , and five fingers on its grasping hands ( two of the fingers on each hand were very small ) . the fossil was found in the ischigualasto formation in the argentine . this contains some of the oldest known dinosaur and archosaur remains . they are of top quality , number and importance . it is the only place in the world where nearly all of the triassic is represented in an undisturbed sequence of strata . what is now badlands was then a volcanically active floodplain dominated by rivers , with a strongly seasonal rainfall .
