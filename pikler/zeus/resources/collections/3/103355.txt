Scanning electron microscope     the scanning electron microscope ( sem ) is a type of electron microscope that uses a focused beam of high-energy electrons in producing a variety of signals at the surface of a solid specimen . the signals produced by the interacting electrons contain useful information such as the shape , atomic structure and conductivity . when an electron hits the surface , it may be reflected ( `` backscattered '' ) , absorbed , or conducted away . electrons that are absorbed can cause the atom that they hit to become unstable , forcing it to give off another electron ( a secondary electron ) , or to give off light in order to stabilize . different detectors , for the different types of reactions , may be fitted to an electron microscope , depending on what is being looked for . the magnification that can be achieved in a scanning electron microscope depends on how narrow the beam of electrons that strikes the surface can be , and can reach 1 nanometer , about the size of 3 to 5 atoms . the control of the beam is achieved using magnetic fields , with other magnetic fields being used to shape the beam , and to move it across the sample . the range of magnification may range from 30x to as high as 500,000x .
