Scientific theory     in everyday speech , the word `` theory '' is used as a `` best guess '' . in modern science , a scientific theory is a tested and expanded hypothesis that explains many experiments . it fits ideas together in a framework . if anyone finds a case where all or part of a scientific theory is false , then that theory is either changed or thrown out . an example of a scientific theory that underwent many changes is the germ theory of disease . in ancient times , people believed that diseases were caused by the gods , or by curses , or by improper behavior . germs ( microorganisms ) were unknown , because germs are too small to see . with the invention of the microscope , germs were discovered , and the germ theory of disease was proposed . thanks to the germ theory of disease , many diseases can now be cured . however , the germ theory of disease had to be modified , because some diseases are not caused by germs . the flu and scurvy are examples of diseases that are not caused by bacteria , but viruses or poor nutrition . scientists modified the germ theory of disease , so that today we would state that theory as `` some diseases are caused by germs '' .
