Lake Enriquillo     lake enriquillo is a lake in western dominican republic , near the border with haiti . its taíno name was `` hagueygagon '' but , in colonial times , it had the name `` jaragua lake '' . it is in the `` hoya de enriquillo '' valley , a long valley between the `` sierra de neiba '' , to the north , and the `` sierra de bahoruco '' , to the south . the lake has an area of 265 km² , and its surface is around 44 meters below sea level , the lowest point in the caribbean . there are three small islands in the lake : isla cabritos , barbarita , and la islita . only small rivers flow into the lake . the rivers that flow from the sierra de neiba always have water . those rivers that flow from the sierra de bahoruco sometimes do not have water . it is a salt water lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water because the rivers that flow into the lake are small and the evaporation of its water is high . many water birds visit the lake to feed , including flamingos . there are also american crocodiles and some fishes as tilapia . because it is an arid region , the vegetation around the lake is poor with cacti and small shrubs .
