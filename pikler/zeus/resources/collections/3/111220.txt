Miaphysitism     miaphysitism ( or henophysitism ) is an idea about the nature of christ . the idea says that jesus christ had two different aspects , one godly , and one human . it says these two aspects are united in one nature . they are indistinguishable , and they co-exist . this is very close to the idea of dualism which says that the mind and the body are separate things that combine to make one unit , the person . in the case of miaphysitism , the separate things are jesus ' divine and human traits . miaphysitism has often been considered by chalcedonian christians to be a form of monophysitism , but the oriental orthodox churches themselves reject this characterization , recently , the eastern orthodox and roman catholic churches have begun to take this position more seriously .
