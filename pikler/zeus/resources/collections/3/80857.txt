Atomic orbital     atomic orbitals are the places surrounding the nucleus of an atom where the electrons are most likely to be at any given time . it used to be believed that electrons behaved similarly to the solar system , where the nucleus is like the sun and the electrons orbit like the planets . however , electrons do not go in circles , they move in many different directions . the number of atomic orbitals in an element is defined by the period the element is in . electrons move between orbitals depending on how fast they are moving and how many other electrons there are . related pages . - electron cloud - molecular orbital
