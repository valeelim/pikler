Umbriel (moon)    umbriel ( moon ) umbriel is a moon of uranus found on october 24 , 1851 by william lassell . it was found at the same time as ariel . the name `` umbriel '' and the names of all four moons of uranus then known were suggested by john herschel in 1852 at the request of lassell . lassell had earlier supported herschel 's 1847 naming scheme for the seven then-known moons of saturn and had named his newly-found eighth moon hyperion in accordance with herschel 's naming scheme in 1848. umbriel is the 'dusky melancholy sprite ' in alexander pope 's `` the rape of the lock '' , and the name suggests the latin `` umbra '' , shadow . the adjectival form of the name is `` umbrielian '' . it is also designated uranus ii . so far the only close-up images of umbriel are from the `` voyager 2 '' probe , which made observations of the moon during its uranus flyby in january , 1986. during the flyby the southern hemisphere of the moon was pointed towards the sun so only it was studied . umbriel 's surface is the darkest of the uranian moons , and reflects only about half as much light as ariel , uranus ' brightest moon . it has far more and bigger craters than do ariel and titania and is also the least geologically active . it is mostly made of water ice , with the balance made up of silicate rock , and other ices such as methane . methane can break down and form reddish-black organic compounds such as tholins when bombarded by high-energy particles . near-ir spectra of ariel and umbriel clearly show that water ice dominates the spectra of these objects .
