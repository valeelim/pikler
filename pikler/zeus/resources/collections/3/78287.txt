Vector graphics     vector graphics ( also called graphical modeling , or object-oriented graphics ) is a type of computer graphics . vector graphics uses geometrical objects , like points , lines , curves , and polygons to model the image . mathematics can be used to describe the graphics . most often vectors and matrices are used . the other way to model computer graphics is to use raster graphics . raster graphics model images as a collection of pixels . unlike raster images , vector-based images can be scaled indefinitely without loss of quality . vector graphics are most often used for diagrams , and other things that can be described using simple shapes . photographs are most often raster images . related pages . - raster graphics
