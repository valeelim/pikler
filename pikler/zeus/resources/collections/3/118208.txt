Assyrian Church of the East     the assyrian church of the east also called holy apostolic catholic assyrian church of the east is a christian church . it is one of the earliest churches to separate from the larger church . it traces its origins to the see of seleucia-ctesiphon , started by saint thomas the apostle as well as saint mari and addai as shown in the doctrine of addai . this church is sometimes known as the `` nestorian church '' , the `` syrian church '' or the `` persian church . '' the church is currently headed by mar dinkha iv . other names have been given as well , but they are not accurate . one of these names is assyrian orthodox church , which has led some people to believe that it is part of the oriental orthodox community . the church itself does not use the word `` orthodox '' in any of its service books or in any of its official correspondence , nor does it use any word which can be translated as `` correct faith '' or `` correct doctrine '' , the rough translation of the word orthodox . in india , it is known as the chaldean syrian church . in the west it is often known as the nestorian church . the church itself believes that the term 'nestorian church ' is chosen badly .
