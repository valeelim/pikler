Hat-trick     a hat-trick , hat trick or hattrick in sports means that something is done 3 times . for example : goals , wickets and so forth . there are different interpretations as to when a hat-trick is a valid one . the most common criteria is when a player has scored 3 goals in a match . goals from penalty shootouts are not included . a `` flawless '' or `` german '' hattrick is close to the hat-trick described above but is different since the 3 goals have to be scored within a certain period of time . another example is the `` classic '' or `` perfect '' hat-trick which means that the player scored one goal with each foot ( 1 goal with the right-foot and one goal with the left-foot ) and a header . occasionally germans would award the hatrickees with 3 medals to signify their loss .
