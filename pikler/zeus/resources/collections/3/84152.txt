Freerunning sleep     freerunning sleep can be sleep which is not adjusted , `` entrained '' , to the 24-hour cycle in nature . sleep which is entrained to 24 hours but is not artificially regulated by alarm clocks etc . can also be called freerunning sleep . animals which are kept in a laboratory for research in `` constant conditions '' , that is in constant light or constant dark , will `` freerun '' . they live by their built-in circadian rhythms . each day will be a little bit shorter or a little bit longer than 24 hours . it will be shorter if the animal 's natural cycle is less than 24 hours long . the animals sleep and are active as usual , but their timing gets to be farther and farther off . scientists let the animals freerun and then do experiments to see what sort of signals are most effective at entraining them . they also experiment to see how long or short a cycle that animal can be entrained to . some animals can be entrained to a 22-hour day , but they can not be entrained to a 20-hour day . light is the most effective signal . some animals are quite easily entrained by the timing of meals . exercise is a signal for some animals . heat is not effective .
