Unknown (math)    unknown ( math ) in mathematics , an unknown is a number we do not know . in algebra , an unknown is represented by a letter . for example , in the equation `` e '' = `` m '' `` c '' , the letter `` m '' represents an unknown mass , and the letter `` e '' represents an unknown amount of energy . not all letters in algebra represent unknowns . in the example above , `` c '' represents a known quantity , the speed of light , which is about 186 thousand miles per second . because `` c '' is so large , the formula `` e '' = `` m '' `` c '' tells a person who understands algebra that in an atomic reaction , a small amount of mass can produce a very large amount of energy .
