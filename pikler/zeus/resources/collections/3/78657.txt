Soft water     soft water is water which has relatively low concentration of calcium carbonate and other ions . the water that lathers with soap easily is called or known as soft water . it describes type of water that contain few or no minerals like calcium ( ca ) or magnesium ( mg ) ions . the term is usually relative to `` hard water '' , which does contain significant amounts of such ions . soft water mostly comes from peat or igneous rock sources , such as granite but may also come from sandstone sources , since those sedimentary rocks are usually low in calcium and magnesium . hard water may be better for the heart than soft water . its calcium ( ca ) and magnesium ( mg ) ions may be a dietary supplement for some . the main disadvantage of hard water is it deposits calcium carbonate on pipes , especially hot water pipes . this is called `` scale formation '' . it may cause blockage of pipes and reduce boiler efficiency . also , soap and detergents work less well in hard water . these effects increase as hardness increases .
