Scenario     in context with theatre and movies a scenario ( from italian , `` that which is pinned to the scenery '' ) is a description of an event or series of actions and events . in the `` commedia dell'arte '' it was an outline of entrances , exits , and action describing the story of a play that was literally pinned to the back of the scenery . surviving scenari from the renaissance contain little other than character names , brief descriptions of action , and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation . it is believed that a scenario forms the basis of a fully improvisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate . in the creation of an opera or ballet , a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source , if any , is to be adapted . this sketch can be helpful in `` pitching '' the idea to a prospective producer , director , or composer . scenarios are also used in policy planning , and when trying out strategies against uncertain future developments . here the key idea is for the scenario to be an overview , a summary , of a projected course of action , events or situations . scenarios are widely used by organizations of all types to understand different ways that future events might unfold .
