Digamma     digamma or wau ( uppercase/lowercase ϝ ϝ ͷ ͷ ) was an old letter of the greek alphabet . it was used before the alphabet got its classical standard form . it looked like a latin `` f '' , but it was pronounced like `` w '' . in the 5th century bc people stopped using it , because they could no longer pronounce the sound `` w '' in greek . however , they kept it as a sign for the number `` 6 '' in the system of greek numerals . it was originally called `` wau '' because of its sound , but later , when the sound was lost , it was called `` digamma '' , which means `` double gamma '' , because it looks like a gamma ( γ ) with two hooks . the latin letter f was also taken over from wau . other websites . - digamma
