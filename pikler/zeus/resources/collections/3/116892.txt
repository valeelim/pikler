Kilmarnock     kilmarnock ( ; locally known as `` killie '' ) is a large burgh in east ayrshire , scotland , with 44,170 people . it is roughly between glasgow and ayr , and is the second largest town in ayrshire . the river irvine runs through its eastern section , and the kilmarnock water passes through it , giving rise to the name 'bank street ' . the name comes from the gaelic `` cill '' ( `` cell '' ) , and the name of saint marnoch or mernoc who is also remembered in the name of portmarnock in ireland , and inchmarnock . it may come from the three gaelic elements `` mo '' , 'my ' , `` ernán '' ( name of the saint ) and the diminutive `` ag '' , giving `` church of my little ernán '' . some people think that the saint founded a church there in the 7th century . there are 12 church of scotland congregations in the town , plus other denominations . in 2005 , the reverend david w. lacy , minister of the town 's henderson church , was elected moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland . the core of the early town appears to have lain around what is now the laigh kirk ( low church ) , although the oldest parts of the current building are no earlier than the 17th century , extending north and northwest . a comparatively modest settlement until the industrial revolution , kilmarnock extended considerably from around 1800 onwards . this resulted in formal , planned developments such as king street , portland street , saint marnock street , and latterly john finnie street ; the latter often suggested as one of the finest victorian planned streets in scotland .
