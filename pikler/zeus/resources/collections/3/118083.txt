Ecclesiastes     ecclesiastes is a book in the old testament of the bible . it is described as `` the words of the philosopher , david 's son , who was king in jerusalem '' ( verse 1 ) . this is probably solomon . the book talks about the meaning of life and the best way to live . people disagree about what the book of ecclesiastes means . some people think the book is very pessimistic , saying `` all is vain '' , `` there is nothing new under the sun . `` ( chapter i ) , and `` i looked again at all the injustice that goes on in this world . the oppressed were weeping but no one would help them . no one would help them , because their oppressors had power on their side . i envy those who are dead and gone ; they are better off than those who are still alive . but better off than either are those who have never been born . '' ( chapter 4 ) other people think the book says that even though life is hard and we will all die someday , we should just enjoy god 's gifts . the book finishes by saying : `` '' fear god , and keep his commandments ; for that is the whole duty of everyone '' ( 12:13 ) .
