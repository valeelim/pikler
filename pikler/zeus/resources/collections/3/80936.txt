Roche limit     the roche limit ( ) , sometimes referred to as the roche radius , is the distance within which a celestial body , held together only by its own gravity , will disintegrate due to a second celestial body 's tidal forces exceeding the first body 's gravitational self-attraction . inside the roche limit , orbiting material will tend to disperse and form planetary rings , while outside the limit , material will tend to coalesce . the term is named after édouard roche , the french astronomer who first calculated this theoretical limit in 1848. sources . - édouard roche : `` la figure d'une masse fluide soumise à l'attraction d'un point éloigné '' , acad . des sciences de montpellier , vol . 1 ( 1847–50 ) p. 243 other websites . - detailed derivation of formulae for calculating the roche limit - discussion of the roche limit
