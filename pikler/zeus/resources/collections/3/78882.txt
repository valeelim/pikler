Usury     usury is lending money for interest . nowadays it usually means lending at a high , often extortionate rate of interest on a loan . usury is illegal in many parts of the world . in muslim countries charging any interest at all is illegal . some people argue that this is against the old testament , especially exodus and deuteronomy which states that those who lend to someone in need will be blessed , but the point about usury is the high levels of interest , not the act of lending in itself . aristotle also condemned usury as `` contraty to nature '' in his book on politics , because if increases by itself and makes money without labour .
