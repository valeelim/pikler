Langston Hughes     langston hughes ( 1902 â€“ may 22 , 1967 ) was an american poet , novelist , playwright and short story writer . hughes was one of the writers and artists whose work was called the harlem renaissance . hughes grew up as a poor boy from missouri , the descendant of african people who had been taken to america as slaves . at that time , the term used for african-americans was `` negro '' which means a person with black skin . most `` negroes '' did not remember or think about their link with the people of africa , even though it was a big influence on their culture and , in particular , their music . hughes was unusual for his time , because he went back to west africa to understand more about his own culture . through his poetry , plays and stories , hughes helped other black americans to see themselves as part of a much bigger group of people , so that now the term `` african-american '' is used with pride . hughes became a famous writer , but all his life he remembered how he started out , and he helped and encouraged many other struggling writers .
