Leonidas I     leonidas i ( c. 530–480 b.c . ) was a king of the city-state of sparta from about 490 bc until his death in 480. the spartans and associates defended the pass at thermopylae against the persian army although leonidas lost the battle , his death at thermopylae was seen as a heroic sacrifice . leonidas sent most of his army away when he realized that the persians had outmaneuvered him . three hundred of his fellow spartans stayed with him to fight and die . almost everything that is known about leonidas comes from the work of the greek historian herodotus ( c. 484–c . 425 bc ) in 480 bc , the persians with their king xerxes attacked greece . when the greeks asked the spartans to join their army against the persians , the spartans went to the oracle at delphi . the oracle gave a prophecy . it said that either sparta would fall or the spartans would lose a king . in august 480 bc , leonidas went to thermopylae with 300 of his bodyguards . other greek forces joined him there and formed an army of 4,000 soldiers . this army would try to hold the pass of thermopylae against the great army of xerxes i , king of persia .
