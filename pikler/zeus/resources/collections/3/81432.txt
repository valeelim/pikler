Veto     a right of veto means that somebody can stop decisions or legislation . for example , the president of the united states has veto power over the usa 's congress . this can stop legislation from being passed . if the president vetoes a bill passed by the congress , it only becomes a law if congress passes it again , this time with at least twice as many members of each of the two houses voting for it than voting against it . similarly , the five permanent members of the united nations security council ( the united states of america , the united kingdom , china , russia and france ) each has veto power . using this , they can stop the security council 's decisions from being passed and becoming resolutions unless they all agree to them . these vetoes can not be overturned by any more voting on that resolution ; if there is a need to address the same issue again in the future , a new and separate resolution must be written , passed , and not vetoed . the veto was invented in ancient times for the roman tribunes so they could protect the people from bad laws made by the roman senate .
