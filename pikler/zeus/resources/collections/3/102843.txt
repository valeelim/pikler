History of the Americas     the history of the americas is the history of north and south america , including central america and the caribbean . it begins with people migrating to these areas from asia and possibly oceania during the height of an ice age . these groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the `` old world '' until the coming of europeans in the 10th and 15th centuries . the ancestors of today 's native americans were hunter-gatherers who migrated into north america . the most popular theory says that migrants came to the americas via the bering land bridge , beringia , the land mass covered by the cold ocean waters in the bering strait . small paleo-indian groups probably followed the mammoth and other prey animals . it is possible that groups of people may also have traveled into north america on shelf or sheet ice along the northern pacific coast . cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as iroquois on north america and quechuas of south america . these cultures later developed into civilizations . in many cases , these cultures expanded at a later date than their old world counterparts . cultures that may be considered advanced or civilized include : zapotec , toltecs , olmec , maya , aztecs , and the inca .
