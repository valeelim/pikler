Left Hand Path     left hand path is a term used in occultism for one kind of spiritual path . it is the opposite of the right hand path , which is what most people think of when they think of religion or spirituality . the use of this term in occultism came from a term used in hindu tantra , `` vama marga '' in sanskrit . this ancient form of tantra used the breaking of rules ( taboos ) as part of the practice . rules about diet and sex were broken on purpose . for example , rules against eating meat and drinking alcohol might be broken . such a practice might require eating meat and drinking alcohol while having sex in a graveyard or cremation ground . people who follow the left hand path in the west are not interested in giving up pleasure or the world in order to be spiritual . they are not interested in worshiping god or following rules made up by others . they seek to gain power and freedom by breaking through taboos , fears and restrictions . many people link this term with satanism and black magic , but they are not the same . the left hand path is sometimes described as `` amoral '' .
