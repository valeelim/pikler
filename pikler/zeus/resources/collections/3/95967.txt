704 Interamnia     704 interamnia is a very big asteroid . scientists think it is 350 kilometers wide . its mean distance from the sun is 3.067 ( au ) . it was found on october 2 , 1910 by vincenzo cerulli . it is named after the latin name for teramo , italy , which is where cerulli worked . it is the fifth heaviest asteroid after ceres , vesta , pallas and hygiea , and scientists think that it makes up 2.0 % of the mass of the whole asteroid belt . although the biggest asteroid apart from the `` big four '' , interamnia is not studied a lot . it is easily the biggest of the f-type asteroids , but there exist very few details of what the inside is made of or shape and no lightcurve analysis has yet been done to find out the ecliptic coordinates of interamnia 's poles ( and hence its axial tilt ) . its apparently high bulk density ( though subject to much error ) suggests a very solid body entirely without internal porosity or traces of water . this also strongly suggests that interamnia is big enough to have fully withstood all the collisions that have happened in the asteroid belt since the solar system was made .
