Asynchronous Transfer Mode     asynchronous transfer mode is a set of protocols used for computer networks . it is mostly used for wide area networks ( wan ) . it splits the data , and encodes it into packets of a fixed size . each packet can be routed differently , along virtual paths set up in the network . atm has been very successful in wans , as well as in local area networks ( lan ) . today , many adsl implementations use atm technology . standards like ethernet ( which is used for lans ) usually are quite simple . when there is little traffic on the network they work well . however , when there is a lot of traffic it is difficult to predict how an ethernet network will behave . for this reason , ethernet can not give any service guarantees . it is not possible to say that an ethernet packet will take a maximum delay , but after that time it is guaranteed to arrive . atm is more complex , but this complexity allows to give guarantees as to data rate , maximum delay , and jitter . these are usually called quality of service .
