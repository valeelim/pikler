Popol Vuh     the popol vuh ( `` k'iche '' ' for `` council book '' or `` book of the community '' ; popol wu'uj in modern spelling ) is a book written in the classical quiché language . it contains mythological stories and a genealogy of the rulers of the post-classic quiché maya kingdom of highland guatemala . the book contains a creation myth followed by mythological stories of two hero twins : hunahpu ( modern k'iche ' : `` junajpu '' ) and xbalanque ( modern k'iche ' : `` xb ‘ alanke '' ) . the second part of the book deals with details of the foundation and history of the quiché kingdom . the book is written in the latin alphabet , but it is thought to have been based on an original maya codex . the original manuscript which was written around 1550 has been lost , but a copy of another handwritten copy in the early 18th century exists today in chicago . the significance of the book is enormous since it is one of a small number of early mesoamerican mythological texts — it is often considered the single most important piece of mesoamerican literature .
