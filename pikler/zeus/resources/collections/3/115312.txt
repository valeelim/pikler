Herbert Spencer     herbert spencer ( 27 april 1820 â€“ 8 december 1903 ) was an english philosopher , and a prominent liberal political and social theorist of the victorian era . spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution . he saw evolution as the progressive development of the physical world , biological organisms , the human mind , and human culture and societies . spencer never married ; he remained a bachelor . he contributed to a wide range of subjects , including ethics , religion , politics , philosophy , biology , sociology , and psychology . like charles darwin and alfred russel wallace , he read malthus ' `` essay on the principle of population '' , and was deeply impressed by its argument . malthus said that sooner or later population growth gets checked by famine and disease , and there are then many deaths . so , he was prepared for darwin 's idea of natural selection , which he preferred to call `` survival of the fittest '' . he did this in `` principles of biology '' ( 1864 ) , after reading charles darwin 's `` on the origin of species '' .
