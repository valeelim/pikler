Scrabble     scrabble is a game that is played by 2 , 3 or 4 people . it uses a board with squares on it ( 15x15 ) and a large number of letters on small tiles . each player , when it is his/her turn , has to put a word on the board , using any of the seven letters ( seven tiles ) that they have in front of them . their word must join on to what is already on the board . the players decide who is going to start by taking one letter ( one tile ) from the bag . the person with the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet may start . each player takes seven tiles from the bag ( without looking at what they are ) . the player puts these tiles on a rack in front of him so that he can see them , but the others can not see which letters he has . after each turn a player can take some new letters out of the bag so that he has seven letters again for his next turn . the first player puts a word on the board using some , or all , of his seven letters as possible . he must include the square in the middle . it is then the next player 's turn . his word must join on somewhere to what the other player has already put . sometimes it is possible to make two or more words in one turn by touching other letters , but each word on the board reading horizontally ( left to right ) or vertically ( top to bottom ) must be a proper word ( no names ) but abbreviations ( shortened forms ) are allowed .
