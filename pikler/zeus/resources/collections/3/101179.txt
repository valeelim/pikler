Exponential function     in mathematics , an exponential function is a function that quickly grows . more precisely , it is the function formula_1 , where e is euler 's constant , an irrational number that is approximately 2.71828. because exponential functions use exponentiation , they follow the same rules . thus , the natural logarithm is the inverse operation of an exponential function . this may also seem unintuitive because of a fundamental property in differential calculus : this means that the slope of an exponential function is an exponential function itself , and subsequently this means it has a slope of 1 at formula_7 . these properties are the reason it is an important function in mathematics . the exponential function is among the most useful of mathematical functions . it is used to represent exponential growth , which has uses in virtually all science subjects and it is also prominent in finance . one example of an exponential function in real life would be interest in a bank . if a person deposits Â£100 into an account which gets 3 % interest a month then the balance each month would be ( assuming the money is untouched ) :
