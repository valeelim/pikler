279 Thule     279 thule is a very big main belt asteroid . it is classified as a d-type asteroid and is probably made of organic rich silicates , carbon and anhydrous silicates . the orbit of thule is unusual . it appears to orbit in the farthest edge of the main belt in a 3:4 orbital resonance with planet jupiter . unlike the hilda asteroids whose eccentricity is fairly common of main belt asteroids , thule has a very low eccentricity - actually much lower than that of jupiter itself and only a bit higher than that of earth . why it has this orbit is not clear , as is the reason for the absence of smaller bodies in similar 4:3 resonances with jupiter . some astronomers have argued that thule 's present orbit is the natural result of the force of jupiter on a body orbiting at exactly the distance from the sun thule does , in the same way ( though with the reverse effect ) as the kirkwood gaps in the more closer parts of the asteroid belt . it could thus be that the resonance which holds thule in a very low-eccentricity orbit serves to eject other smaller bodies whose distance from the sun is only a bit different from that of thule itself .
