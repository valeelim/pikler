Phenomenology     phenomenology is a way of thinking about ourselves . instead of asking about what we `` really '' are , it focuses on `` phenomena '' . these are experiences that we get from the senses - what we see , taste , smell , touch , hear , and feel . phenomenology does not ask if what we are seeing is `` actually '' there , for example it is not where we see an object either in real life , a dream or a hallucination that is important but it is the significance of the object that is important to the phenomenologist . it also does not ask if we are missing something , or if we have all the facts . instead , phenomenologists ( those who do phenomenology ) believe we should look at the world just as it appears to us . martin heidegger , a famous phenomenologist , said that philosophers should be looking at how we live in our `` average everydayness . '' in his book being and time , he uses many examples of how people live in their normal lives . jean-paul sartre did the same in his book being and nothingness . for example , he writes about meeting a friend at a cafe . however , the friend , named pierre , never shows up . sartre writes that he can feel the absence of pierre in the cafe . because of this , he says that non-pierre ( or the lack of pierre ) is something that exists , at least for him . it exists because he can feel it .
