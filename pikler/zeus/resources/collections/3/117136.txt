Manorialism     manorialism or seigneurialism is the name for the organization of the economy in the middle ages . the economy relied mainly on agriculture . manorialism describes how land was distributed and who profited from the land . a lord received a piece of land , usually from a higher nobleman , or from the king . when he received the land , he also received all that was on it . that means that most of the people that lived on the land also belonged to the nobleman . the people , called peasants , had to pay to the lord , or they had to work for him . this way , the nobleman could live and support his family from what he received from the peasants . he had also certain legal powers , like that of a police force . the peasants were subjects which had to pay tribute to the lord . in return they received protection . the tribute the subjects had to pay varied . it could either be that they had to do work for their lord , or that had to pay a certain part of what they earned ( like `` one tenth '' ) . that meant that if they grew a crop such as some form of corn , the lord got a tenth of their earnings in corn . this is also called `` payment in nature '' or sharecropping . very rarely , it was money they had to pay .
