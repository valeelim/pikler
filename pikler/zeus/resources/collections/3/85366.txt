Trans fat     trans fat is an artificial food . most of it is made in factories . trans fat occurs in nature only very rarely . when vegetable oils are heated or when they are `` hydrogenated '' , trans fats are made . hydrogenation is the process of bubbling hydrogen gas through the oil to change its consistency . the bubbling raises the melting point of the oil . as the hydrogen passes through , the oil begins to become solid . by stopping the hydrogenation part of the way through , manufacturers obtain `` partially hydrogenated oil '' . this is similar to butter , but much cheaper to produce . it is sold as `` margarine '' , `` oleo '' or `` vegetable shortening '' . the process allows cheaply adding a butter-like consistency to food products . trans fat is bad for human health and has been tied to a number of problems including : coronary heart disease , cancer , diabetes , obesity , liver dysfunction , and infertility . healthy oils are always liquid at the temperature of blood . saturated and trans fats are not . there has yet to be a study which shows that trans fat is good for human health in any way . since scientists and nutritionists now know the health issues related to eating trans fats , trans fats are being used less but there are still some in commercial food products .
