X Window System     the x window system is a set of protocols and programs . it is also known as x11 , or simply x. it can manage windows , and other components of a graphical user interface on a bitmap display . this way of doing graphics is most common in unix-like operating systems . x provides the basic components to build gui environments : drawing and moving windows on the screen and interacting with a mouse or a keyboard . x does not say what the user interface should look like â€” different client programs handle this . different x11-based environments have radically different designs . x is not a part of the operating system ; instead , it is built as an additional program on top of the operating system . unlike previous display protocols , x was specifically designed to be used over network connections rather than on a display near the computer . x has network transparency : the machine where an application program ( the `` client '' application ) runs need not be the user 's local machine ( the display `` server '' ) .
