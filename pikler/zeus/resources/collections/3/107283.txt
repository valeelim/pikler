Polynomial     when you see letters mixed with numbers and arithmetic , like `` x '' +2 '' x '' -7 , there is a good chance that it is a polynomial . mathematicians , scientists , and engineers use polynomials to solve problems . polynomials are taught in algebra , which is a gateway course to all technical subjects . in algebra , when you see letters , numbers , and arithmetic , the understanding is that the letters stand either for numbers you do not know ( and may want to find ) or for numbers that change during the course of the problem , variables , such as time . if the only arithmetic is addition , subtraction , multiplication , and whole number exponents , then that mixture of letters , numbers , and arithmetic is called a polynomial . if harder operations are used , such as division or square roots , then what you have is an `` algebraic expression '' . a polynomial is an easy-to-use algebraic expression . polynomials are often used to form polynomial equations , such as `` x '' +2 '' x '' -7 = 0 , or polynomial functions , such as `` f '' ( `` x '' ) = `` x '' +2 '' x '' -7 .
