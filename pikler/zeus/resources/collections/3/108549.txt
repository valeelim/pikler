Seahorse     seahorses , genus hippocampus , are a type of teleost fish . they are called 'seahorses ' because their head looks like that of a horse . there are about 32–48 species of seahorse . they live in tropical oceans . seahorses rely on camouflage to avoid detection . seahorses are unique because the male hatches the eggs in a pouch on his belly . the female inserts her ovipositor into the male ’ s brood pouch and deposits dozens to thousands of eggs . as the female releases her eggs , her body slims while his swells . the male releases his sperm directly into the water ; sperm then fertilize the eggs in the pouch . the fertilised eggs are then embedded in the pouch wall . they get nutrition and oxygen from the fluid in the pouch . in the pouch , the salinity of the water is regulated ; this prepares the newborns for life in the sea . both animals then sink back into the seagrass and she swims away . the eggs then hatch throughout gestation , which in most species requires two to four weeks , his mate visits him daily for 'morning greetings ' . they interact for about 6 minutes . the female then swims away until the next morning , and the male vacuums up food through his snout .
