Weather front     a weather front is a boundary in between two masses of air of different densities , and is the main cause of significant weather . in surface weather analyses , fronts are depicted using various colored lines and symbols . the air masses separated by a front usually differ in temperature and humidity . cold fronts may feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather , and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines . warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog . the weather usually quickly clears after a front passes . some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness , although there is usually a wind shift .
