Scalp     the scalp is the anatomical area between the face and the neck . it is usually described as having five layers , which can be remembered with the mnemonic `` scalp '' : - s : the skin on the head from which head hair grows . it is richly supplied with blood vessels . - c : connective tissue . a thin layer of fat and fibrous tissue lies beneath the skin - a : the aponeurosis ( or galea aponeurotica ) is the next layer . it is a tough layer of dense fibrous tissue - l : the `` loose areolar connective tissue '' layer provides an easy plane of separation between the upper three layers and the `` pericranium '' . in scalping the scalp is torn off through this layer . - p : the pericranium is the periosteum of the skull bones and provides nutrition to the bone and the capacity for repair . it may be lifted from the bone to allow removal of bone windows ( craniotomy ) .
