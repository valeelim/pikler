Build God, Then We'll Talk    build god , then we 'll talk `` build god , then we 'll talk '' is the fifth and last official single , written by ryan ross , from panic at the disco 's 2005 album , `` a fever you ca n't sweat out '' , including the radio-only single `` the only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage '' . the song is the last song on panic at the disco 's d√©but album `` a fever you ca n't sweat out '' . the bridge melody of `` build god , then we 'll talk '' is a derivative of the melody of the chorus of `` my favorite things '' from `` the sound of music '' . the lyrics in the bridge also directly satirize the lyrics of `` my favorite things '' . the song depicts the story of a virgin who , in desperate need of cash , agrees to sleep with a powerful lawyer in exchange for a job at the firm . his wife , despite knowing about his late ventures , stays with him for the same reason this girl has been manipulated into sleeping with him ; money . however , the lawyer has tipped off the police , claiming her to be a prostitute , and , just hours after he leaves , the constable bursts in while she 's fixing her hair in a compact . surprised , she knocks her bag over , spilling the contents , and the officer gives her an option- go to jail or sleep with him . in the album there are extended lyrics confirming this .
