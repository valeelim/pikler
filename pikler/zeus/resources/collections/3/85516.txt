DDR2 SDRAM     in information technologies we use the term ddr2 sdram for a double data rate memory module of the second generation . this technology is used for high speed storage of the working data . the main difference between ddr and ddr2 modules is that the bus on which the ddr2 memory modules are working is clocked at twice the speed of the memory cells . in practical terms we can say that four words of data can be transferred during one memory cell cycle . to sum it up ddr2 can effectively operate at twice the bus speed of ddr . for use in pcs , ddr2 sdram is supplied in dimms with 240 pins and a single locating notch . dimms are identified by their peak transfer capacity ( often called bandwidth ) .
