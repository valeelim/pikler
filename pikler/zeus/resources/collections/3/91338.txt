'' . on january 1 , 2008 , the snippets finally were revealed to be part of a new song entitled `` we 're so starving '' . a rough version of this song was then released for listening on their official myspace page , but was later pulled with the release of `` nine in the afternoon '' . a review from `` nme '' magazine was published on the internet with descriptions of each song . these reviews show the big different direction that panic have taken with their new album .
