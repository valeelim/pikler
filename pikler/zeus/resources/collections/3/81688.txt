Carme group     the carme group is a group of retrograde non-spherical moons of jupiter that follow similar orbits to carme and are thought to have a common origin . their semi-major axes ( distances from jupiter ) range between 22,900,000 and 24,100,000 km , their inclinations between 164.9° and 165.5° , and their orbital eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.27 ( with one exception ) . the core members include ( from biggest to smallest ) : - carme ( the biggest , which gives its name to the group ) - taygete - eukelade - s/2003 j 5 - chaldene - isonoe - kalyke ( redder than the others ) - erinome - aitne - kale - pasithee - s/2003 j 9 - s/2003 j 10 the international astronomical union ( iau ) reserves names in -e for all retrograde moons , including this group 's members . the carme group may once have been a single body that was broken apart by an impact . further support to the single body origin comes from the known colours : all the moons appear light red , and infrared spectra , similar to d-type asteroids .
