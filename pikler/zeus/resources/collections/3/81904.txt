False gharial     the false gharial or malayan gharial ( `` tomistoma schlegelii '' ) is a fresh-water reptile . it looks like a crocodile with a very thin and long snout , like that of the gharial . that is where the name of the species is from . it has long been classed in the family `` crocodylidae '' . however , recent immunological studies show it is more closely related to the gharial than was originally thought . so now classed in the family `` gavialidae '' , after all . the animal is native to six river systems in sumatra and malaysia . it can also be found in borneo , java , vietnam , thailand ( not seen since 1970 ) , and possibly sulawesi . fossils finds in southern china indicate that , at some point in the past , the species occurred there . the false gharial , like all other crocodilians , lays eggs . it is a mound nester . females usually mature at 2â€“3 m. mated females will lay a clutch of 30-60 eggs in a mound of dry leaves or peat . once the eggs are laid , and construction of the mound is completed , she abandons her nest . unlike most other crocodilian species , the young receive no parental care and are at risk of being eaten by predators like wild boar , mongooses , big cats such as tigers and leopards , civets , and wild dogs . the young hatch after 90 days and are left to look after themselves .
