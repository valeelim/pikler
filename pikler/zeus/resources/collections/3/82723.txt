Maniraptor     maniraptors ( `` hand snatchers '' ) is a clade of coelurosaurian dinosaurs starting in the jurassic period . many paleontologists believe birds evolved from them some 150 or so million years ago . hence , according to phylogenetic taxonomy , birds are by definition maniraptors , and the other maniraptors are their closest relatives . it is now known , from the jehol biota , that many or all of this clade had feathers . they are often called dinobirds . the most primitive ( basal ) member of the group may be `` ornitholestes '' , and the most advanced ( derived ) of the non-bird maniraptors is `` deinonychus '' .
