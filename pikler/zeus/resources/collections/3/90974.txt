Aristide Cavaillé-Coll     aristide cavaillé-coll ( born montpellier , 4 february 1811 ; died paris , 13 october 1899 ) was a french organ-builder . most organists think of him as the greatest organ-builder of the 19th century , and one of the greatest who ever lived . he invented many new mechanical devices and his organs changed the way that composers could write for the instrument . césar franck , alexandre guilmant , and charles-marie widor , in particular , were strongly influenced by the new type of organ that he was building . cavaillé-coll grouped the stops of the organ into different families , so that the result was similar to the families of instruments in an orchestra . he made the lowest of the manuals ( keyboards ) the most important one . it was called the “ great ” ( french : “ grande orgue ” ) . the other manuals - there were usually two others , but sometimes three - could be “ coupled ” to the great . he made changes to the english swell box , improved its operation , and divided the windchests on which the pipes were resting . this made it possible to have louder reed stops because of the higher wind pressure .
