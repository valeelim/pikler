Ballpoint pen     a ballpoint pen ( also called a biro - pronounced `` by-roe '' - in british english after its inventor lászló bíró ) , is a modern kind of pen for writing . the ink is inside a long , thin unit inside the pen . when a person writes with it , the ink comes onto the small , ball-shaped tip of the unit . the ink dries almost as soon as it is on the paper . before the ballpoint pen was invented people usually wrote with pens which were dipped into ink , or fountain pens which were filled with ink whenever the ink was all used up . when the ballpoint pen was invented , many people thought they were bad things to use because people 's handwriting was not so good . children in schools had to continue to use ordinary ink pens . however , ballpoint pens were improved , and they are much easier to use than pens that need to be dipped in ink , so almost everybody writes with them now . galileo galilei were working on a draft for an invention similar to the ballpoint pen in the early 1600s . the inventor lászló bíró registered his invention of the ballpoint pen in 1938 .
