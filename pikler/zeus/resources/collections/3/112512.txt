Soricomorpha     the soricomorpha ( `` shrew-form '' ) was a proposed biological group in the class of mammals . it includes all the shrews , solenodons and moles . it is divided into 4 families , one extinct . the other three families are the shrews , solenodons and moles . this followed the discovery , from sequence analysis , that the old order insectivora was polyphyletic . that meant it was not a single clade . the proposal was discarded when it was discovered that a larger grouping was monophyletic , and formed an natural clade of insectivores . that is the new order eulipotyphla . - order soricomorpha - family soricidae - subfamily crocidurinae : white-toothed shrews - subfamily soricinae : red-toothed shrews - subfamily myosoricinae : african white-toothed shrews - family talpidae : moles - subfamily scalopinae - subfamily talpinae - subfamily uropsilinae - family solenodontidae : solenodons - family â€ nesophontidae : west indian shrews
