Peloponnesian War     the peloponnesian war ( 431â€“404 bc ) was an ancient greek military conflict , fought by athens and its allies , against the `` peloponnesian league '' , led by sparta . athens and sparta were the main winners of the earlier greco-persian wars . athens stood for democracy , and sparta for oligarchy , though they fought as much for economic reasons of trade and for the dominance of their respective leagues . sparta eventually won the peloponnesian war . athens was never the same again . athens was the greatest sea power , and sparta the greatest land power in 5th century bc greece . in the first phase , the archidamian war , sparta launched repeated invasions of attica , while athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the peloponnese attempting to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . this period of the war ended in 421 bc , with the signing of the peace of nicias . that treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the peloponnese . in 415 bc , athens dispatched a large force to attack syracuse in sicily . the attack failed , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 bc .
