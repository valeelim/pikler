Archosaur     archosaurs are a large group of reptiles , including all crocodiles , birds , dinosaurs , and pterosaurs ( flying reptiles ) . there are also a number of smaller extinct groups , mostly from the triassic period . the archosaurs are definitely a monophyletic clade , and do not include reptiles such as the squamata ( lizards and snakes ) and the sphenodontia ( `` sphenodon '' ) . they have these diagnostic features , called `` synapomorphies '' in cladistics talk : - teeth set in sockets , which makes them less likely to be torn loose during feeding . some archosaurs , such as birds , are secondarily toothless . - opening in the skull in front of the eyes but behind the nostrils , reduces the weight of the skull . - small openings in the jaw bones , which reduces the weight of the jaw slightly . - legs held under the body rather than sprawled . this improves both breathing and movement . - a special ridge for attaching muscles to the femur . this detail may have made it possible for dinosaurs to stand on two legs . all early dinosaurs and many later ones were bipedal .
