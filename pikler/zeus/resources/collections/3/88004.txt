Twice-cooked pork     twice-cooked pork ( , literally : `` meat that has been returned to the wok '' ) is probably the best-known sichuan-style chinese dish . twice-cooked pork is cooked by boiling pork rib steak chunks in hot water with slices of ginger and salt first , then after being cut into thin slices , the pork is put back into a wok and shallow-fried in hot oil . twice-cooked pork is said to have started in the qing dynasty , while the qianlong emperor toured sichuan . qianlong wanted a feast at every stop that he made , and , when he arrived at one particular village , the villagers were very worried . the crops had not been harvesting well that year and there may not have been enough to host the emperor . they were worried that the emperor would do bad things to them if they did not give him a feast , so they quickly put the food they had not yet eaten back into the pot , cooked it again ( thus `` twice-cooking '' them ) and served the food to the emperor . to their surprise , the emperor enjoyed it , and so the `` twice cooked pork '' became a famous sichuan dish .
