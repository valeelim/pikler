Synchronous orbit     a synchronous orbit is an orbit in which an orbiting body ( usually a satellite ) has a period equal to the average rotational period of the body being orbited ( usually a planet ) . or in smaller words , the orbit above and the spinning planet below , go around once in the same amount of time . it orbits in the same direction of rotation as that body . so if you were on the orbiting body , you would always see the same side of the body being orbited . or if you were on the body being orbited , the orbiting body would stay in the same part of the sky .
