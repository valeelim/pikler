Antares Telescope     the antares experiment is a telescope that is built at the bottom of the mediterranean sea . but it is not a normal telescope that uses light to see distant objects . instead , it uses neutrinos , very small and light particles that can fly through the earth . the name comes from astronomy with a neutrino telescope and abyss environmental research project . there is also a star called antares . it uses 900 light sensors attached to 12 strings that float in the sea to detect neutrinos . the strings are held onto the sea floor by an anchor and straight up by a buoy floating in the sea . although the neutrinos are invisible , they can create a different particle , a muon , in water . the muon then gives off light by the cherenkov effect because it travels faster than light in water . the sensors are so sensitive that they need only very little light and can even detect single photons . this is necessary because the muons produce only very little light . the detector is located in the mediterranean , about 40 kilometres off toulon in southern france . there the sea is 2500 metres deep . it is built by a group of physicists from 12 european countries . currently , 10 strings are running . the last two strings will be installed in may 2008 .
