Te Deum     the te deum is a christian hymn . its original text was latin . it is named after the first few words , `` te deum laudamus '' ( we praise thee , o lord ) . it was probably written around the 4th or 5th century . most say that either augustine of hippo or ambrose wrote it . some say it was by nicetas , bishop of remesiana . others have said that the hymn was taken from two ( or more ) earlier hymns : one to god the father and another to god the son . after this idea , the second hymn begins with the phrase `` tu rex gloriae , christe . '' the petitions at the end of the hymn ( beginning `` salvum fac populum tuum '' ) are from verses from the book of psalms , added to the original hymn later on . te deum is close in theology to the apostles ' creed . it has both a poetic view of the heavenly liturgy with a declaration of faith . `` god '' is named from the start of the song . the hymn then names all people who praise and respect god , from the hierarchy of heavenly creatures , to christians who are already in heaven , to the church in all the world .
