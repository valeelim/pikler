Musical form     the term musical form can have two meanings : - it can mean : the kind of composition . for example , a musical work can be a symphony , a concerto , a sonata etc . this is more often called “ musical genre ” . the word showing the musical genre will show things such as : whether the music is for an orchestra to play and whether or not there is a soloist as well , or whether it is a piece for one instrument on its own . it may give an idea of whether it is likely to be a long piece or a short piece , or whether it has several movements . - it can also mean : the shape of the music and how it is planned . the form of a piece of music may , for example , be an “ aba ” form , which means that there is the first part of the piece ( which we can call part “ a ” ) , then something different happens ( which we can call part “ b ” ) , and finally part “ a ” comes back again . there are many other ways of planning a piece of music , e.g . in jazz there is the twelve bar blues ( in which the music is based on a repeated pattern of chords that last 12 bars , or in classical music there is sonata form which can often be the plan of a movement lasting anything from five minutes ( as in the early classical symphonies ) to half an hour ( as in some of mahler ’ s symphonies ) .
