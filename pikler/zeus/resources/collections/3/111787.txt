Flag of Scotland     the flag of scotland is a white x-shaped cross , which represents the cross of the patron saint of scotland , saint andrew on a blue sky . the flag is called the saltire or the saint andrew 's cross . according to legend , in 832 a.d. king Ã³engus ( ii ) ( or king angus ) led the picts and scots in battle against the angles under a king named athelstan near modern-day athelstaneford in east lothian . king angus and his men were surrounded and he prayed for deliverance . during the night saint andrew , who was martyred on a saltire cross , appeared to angus and assured him of victory . on the following morning a white saltire against the background of a blue sky appeared to both sides . the picts and scots were heartened by this , but the angles lost confidence and were defeated . this saltire design has been the scottish flag ever since . material evidence of the saltire 's use dates from somewhat later . in 1385 the parliament of scotland decreed that scottish soldiers should wear the saltire as a distinguishing mark . the earliest surviving scottish flag consisting solely of the saltire dates from 1503 : a white cross on a red background . by 1540 the legend of king angus had been altered to include the vision of the crux decussata against a blue sky . thereafter , this saltire design in its present form became the national flag of scotland .
