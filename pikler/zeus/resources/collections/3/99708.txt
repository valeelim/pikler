Semantic Web     the semantic web is a project of the w3c that uses metadata to let computers understand the information on the internet . this would make computers able to do more of the work involved in finding , sharing and combining information on the internet . the semantic web is an idea of the inventor of the world wide web , tim berners lee . he wants to make the web more intuitive about how to meet a user 's needs . the semantics of information and services is defined in web ontology language and rdf schemas . these are used to give a formal description of concepts , terms , and relationships within a given area of knowledge . tim berners-lee 's idea was as follows : the world wide web is based on html documents . the semantic web involves using resource description framework ( rdf ) that has data that computers use . the layout used in html will be stored separately such as in a css file . rdf and owl can either supplement or replace the content of web documents ( xhtml ) . in this way a machine can use the knowledge itself . by using the information in ways similar to human reasoning it can create more meaningful results .
