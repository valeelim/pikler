Tropical Storm Melissa (2007)    tropical storm melissa ( 2007 ) tropical storm melissa was the thirteenth named storm of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season . it was a short-lived storm that formed southwest of the cape verde islands , remaining weak because of high wind shear . it dissipated without affecting any land areas . it was only notable for being the eighth named storm of september 2007 , which tied the record for the month of september . the system began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of africa on september 26. an area of low pressure formed on september 27 near cape verde in association with the wave , and convection slowly increased as a result of the low . early on september 28 , a rapid increase in convection and a well-organized outflow pattern allowed the low to develop into tropical depression fourteen while about 115 miles ( 185 km ) west-southwest of the southernmost cape verde islands . since the depression was far removed from the subtropical ridge and an upper-level low pressure area was sitting to the north , steering currents were weak at first and the depression moved very slowly on a general west-northwest track . vertical wind shear from the west also slowed down development . small amounts of strengthening took place early on september 29 as convection increased in the system , and the depression was upgraded to tropical storm melissa .
