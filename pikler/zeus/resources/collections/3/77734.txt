Licchavi     licchavi ( also `` lichchhavi '' , `` lichavi '' ) was an ancient republic which existed in what is now bihar state of india , before the birth of mahavira ( b . 599 bc ) . its capital was vaishali . from about 400 to 750 there existed a kingdom in nepal in the kathmandu valley with the same name `` licchavi '' . early buddhist legends tell that licchavi was a ruling family during gautama buddha 's time in india , however links to the nepalese kingdom are speculative . the language of licchavi inscriptions is sanskrit , and the particular script used is closely related to official gupta scripts . that means that india was a significant cultural influence . this was likely through mithila - the northern part of modern bihar , india . other pages . - nepal other websites . - tamot , kashinath and alsop , ian . `` a kushan-period sculpture , the licchavi kings '' , asianart.com - `` history of nepal , '' thamel.com - `` nepal : the early kingdom of the licchavis , 400-750 '' , library of congress countryreports.org ( september , 1991 )
