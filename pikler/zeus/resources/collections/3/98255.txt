Rings of Rhea     the saturnian moon rhea may have a thin ring system with three narrow bands in a disk of solid particles . these would be the first rings seen around a moon . the discovery was announced in the journal `` science '' on march 6 2008. in november of 2005 the `` cassini '' orbiter found that saturn 's magnetosphere near rhea did not have energetic electrons . according to the discovery team , this is best explained by assuming they were absorbed by solid material in the form of an equatorial disk having denser rings or arcs , with particles perhaps many decimeters to about a meter in diameter . `` voyager '' 1 saw an area without as many energetic electrons trapped in saturn 's magnetic field downstream from rhea in 1980. these measurements , which were never explained , were made at a farther distance than the `` cassini '' data . on november 26 , 2005 , `` cassini '' made the one targeted rhea flyby of its primary mission . it passed within 500 km of rhea 's surface , downstream of saturn 's magnetic field , and saw the resulting plasma wake as it had with other moons , such as dione and tethys . in those cases , there was a cutoff of energetic electrons as `` cassini '' crossed into the moons ' plasma shadows ( the regions where the moons themselves blocked the magnetospheric plasma from reaching `` cassini ) . '' however , in the case of rhea , the electron plasma started to drop off at eight times that distance , and decreased gradually until the expected sharp drop off as `` cassini '' entered rhea 's plasma shadow . the extended distance corresponds to rhea 's hill sphere , the distance of 7.7 times rhea 's radius inside of which orbits are dominated by rhea 's rather than saturn 's gravity . when `` cassini '' emerged from rhea 's plasma shadow , the reverse pattern occurred : a sharp surge in energetic electrons , then a gradual increase out to rhea 's hill-sphere radius .
