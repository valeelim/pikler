Electric fish     an electric fish is a fish that can make electric fields . fishes that can generate such fields are said to be `` electrogenic '' , those that can detect them are called `` electroreceptive '' . most electrogenic fish are also electroreceptive . many fish , for example sharks , rays , and catfishes are electroreceptive . they can not generate electric fields though , and are therefore not classified as electric fish . most bony fish are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive . electrogenic fish have a special organ that can generate electricity . this organ is usually called an electric organ . it is usually near the tail of the fish . it is made from specialised muscle or nerve cells . when the organ produces electricity that is released this is called `` electric organ discharge '' ( or `` eod '' for short ) . based on the strength of the eod , the electrogenic fish can be classified into two types : - `` strongly electric fish '' : their discharge is so strong they can stun ( and capture ) prey with it . examples for such fish are the electric eel ( which is a knifefish , not a true eel ) , electric catfishes , or electric rays
