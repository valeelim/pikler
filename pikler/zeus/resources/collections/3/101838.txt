Relational database     a relational database is a way of storing information ( `` data '' ) . the database matches data by using identical information that is found within the data set . the resulting groups of data are organized and are much easier for many people to understand . for example , a database has all information about real-estate sales in a town . this information can be grouped by year , or by sale price , or by buyer 's last name and so on . such a grouping uses the relational model ( a technical term for this is schema ) . hence , such a database is called a `` relational database . '' the software used to do this grouping is called a relational database management system ( rdbms ) . the term `` relational database '' often refers to this type of software . relational databases are currently the main way in which companies store information like financial records , medical records , personal information and manufacturing and logistical data . the term `` relational database '' was originally defined by and is attributed to edgar codd at ibm almaden research center in 1970 .
