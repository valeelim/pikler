Tatnet     tatnet ( short for `` tatar internet '' ) is the name tatar-speaking internet users commonly use for the `` segment of the internet '' about the tatar people or tatarstan . it includes webpages and websites in many languages . the first e-mail message in tatar was probably sent and received in 1991 when employees of the tatar-bashkir service of radio liberty/radio free europe inc. started using the internet and electronic communication on a regular basis . in 1994 , a tatar-language mailing list ( tmg , standing for tatar mailing group ) was established and this year is commonly regarded as the birthyear of the tatar internet . since approximately 2000 , tatnet has been developing explosively , with many web pages and web sites added to it annually . the existence of tatnet continues to contribute tremendously to the cohesion and consolidation of the tatar people , a significant achievement because tatars are despersed all over the world and a substantial majority of tatars live outside their ethnic homeland , tatarstan . tatar internet users employ latin and cyrillic scripts with the former gradually becoming more dominant .
