Vaisravana     vaiśravaṇa ( sanskrit वैश्रवण ) or vessavaṇa ( pāli वेस्सवण ) is the name of the chief of the four heavenly kings and an important person in buddhism . the name vaiśravaṇa comes from the sanskrit viśravaṇa which means `` great fame '' . vaiśravaṇa is also known as kubera in sanskrit or kuvera in pāli . the character of vaiśravaṇa is set up on the hindu god kubera , but although the buddhist and hindu deities share some characteristics , both of them have different functions and myths . he is often shown with a yellow face . he carries an umbrella as a sign of his power . he is also sometimes shown with a mongoose , often shown spitting out jewels . the mongoose is the enemy of the snake , which is a symbol of greed or hatred ; the spitting out of jewels shows generosity . in the pāli writings of the theravāda buddhist tradition , vaiśravaṇa is called vessavaṇa . vessavaṇa is one of the four great kings , each one of which rules over a direction . vessavaṇa 's direction is the northern quarter of the world .
