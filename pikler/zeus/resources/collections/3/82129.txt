Hydra (moon)    hydra ( moon ) hydra is the farthest moon of pluto . it was found along with nix in june , 2005 by the hubble space telescope 's pluto companion search team , which is composed of hal a. weaver , alan stern , max j. mutchler , andrew j. steffl , marc w. buie , william j. merline , john r. spencer , eliot f. young , and leslie a. young . the discovery images were taken on may 15 , 2005 and may 18 , 2005 ; the moons were independently found by max j. mutchler on june 15 , 2005 and andrew j. steffl on august 15 , 2005. the discoveries were announced on october 31 , 2005 , after confirmation by precoveries from 2002. the moons were provisionally designated s/2005 p 1 ( hydra ) and s/2005 p 2 ( nix ) . the moon orbits the barycenter of the system in the same plane as charon and nix , at a distance of about 65,000 km . unlike other moons of pluto , its orbit is only nearly circular ; its eccentricity of 0.0052 is small , but significantly non-zero . its orbital period of 38.2 days . although its size has not been directly measured , calculations based on its brightness give it a diameter of between 61 km , if its reflectivity is similar to charon 's 35 percent , and about 167 km , if it has a reflectivity of 4 percent like the darkest kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) . at the time of discovery , hydra was about 25 percent brighter than its sister moon nix , which led to the assumption that its diameter was some 10 percent bigger . pre-discovery data from hubble observations in 2002-3 inferred that nix was the brighter moon . however , hubble observations in 2005-6 , specifically targeting the dim moons , once again showed hydra to be a little brighter . hydra appears to be grey like charon and nix , though pluto is reddish .
