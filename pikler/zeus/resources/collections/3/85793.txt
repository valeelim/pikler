298 Baptistina     298 baptistina is a common main belt asteroid . it was found by auguste charlois on september 9 , 1890 in nice . although it has an orbit similar to the flora family asteroids , it was found to be an unrelated asteroid . a 2007 us-czech study decided that 298 baptistina may be the biggest remnant of a 170 km ( 110 mile ) asteroid that was destroyed about 160 million years ago in an impact with a smaller body , making the baptistina family of asteroids and that the baptistina event may have created the eventual impact asteroid believed by many to have caused the k/t extinction event about 65 million years ago . this is the k/t impactor believed to be shown in the geological record . this theory has not , as yet , found general acceptance among the scientific community .
