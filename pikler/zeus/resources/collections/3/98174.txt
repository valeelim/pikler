Can-can     the can-can ( also spelled `` cancan '' or `` can can '' ) is a music hall dance , performed by a chorus line of female dancers who wear costumes with long skirts , petticoats , and black stockings , like the fashions of the 1890s . the can-can was first danced in low class ballrooms of montparnasse in paris about 1830. the dancers of the 1890s , such as la goulue and jane avril , were highly paid for their appearances at the moulin rouge and elsewhere . the female dancers of the french second empire and the fin de si√®cle developed the various cancan moves . the galop from jacques offenbach 's `` orpheus in the underworld '' is the tune most often played with the can-can ( a somewhat simplified form and a more evolved one can-can ( `` orpheus in the underworld '' ) . performed on the accordion ) .
