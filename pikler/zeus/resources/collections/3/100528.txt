Knights of the Round Table     the knights of the round table were characters in the legends about king arthur . they were the best knights in king arthur 's kingdom , and lived in king arthur 's castle , camelot . they were called the knights of the `` round table '' because of a special table that was in camelot , that was round instead of rectangular . this meant that everyone who sat around it was seen as trust worthy and equal . in order to become a knight of the round table , a knight had to prove he was chivalrous ( polite ) enough . in the legend , the knights swore a code of chivalry , which is much like an oath is today . this meant that they promised to uphold the rules given to them once they became a knight of the round table . sir thomas malory ( c. 1405 - march 14th , 1471 ) was an english writer , who wrote a book based on the legend of king arthur . it was called `` le morte d'arthur '' . in it , he wrote his version of the code of chivalry : - to never do outrage nor murder ( not to assault or murder anybody )
