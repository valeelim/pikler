Structure of the Earth     the structure of the earth is divided into layers . these layers are both physically and chemically different . the earth has an outer solid crust , a highly viscous mantle , a liquid outer core , and a solid inner core.the shape of the earth is an oblate spheroid , because it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator the boundaries between these layers were discovered by seismographs which showed the way vibrations bounced off the layers during earthquakes . between the earth 's crust and the mantle is a boundary called the moho . it was the first discovery of a major change in the earth 's structure as one goes deeper . 1. the crust is the outermost layer of the earth . it is made of solid rocks . it is mostly made of the lighter elements , silicon , oxygen , aluminium . because of this , it is known as sial ( silicon = si ; aluminium = al ) or felsic . 1. the mantle is the layer of the earth right below the crust . it is made mostly of oxygen , silicon and the heavier element magnesium . it is known as sima ( si for silicon + ma for magnesium ) or mafic . the mantle itself is divided into layers .
