Kreuzberg     kreuzberg , south of berlin-mitte , was one of the best-known boroughs of berlin , famous for its nightlife and its left-leaning electorate as well as its problems with crime the drug scene and a very high number of immigrants . kreuzberg consists of two different parts , the southeastern 'so 36 ' ( or simply '36 ' ) part and the southwest 'sw 61 ' ( or simply '61 ' ) . until the berlin wall fell , these were the last two numbers of the postal codes for the two areas . it was a separate borough from 1920 , when it became a part of groß-berlin , until the borughs were changed in 2001. then it was joined with friedrichshain to form the new borough of friedrichshain-kreuzberg . since these two localities are linked only by a single bridge over the spree river , the oberbaumbrücke , this joining seemed awkward to many residents . the two areas could not agree on where the new borough 's town hall should be . friedrichshain was chosen by tossing a five-mark coin . kreuzberg is known to many for numerous turkish immigrants from eastern parts of turkey , and the yearly may day riots . this is because before the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , kreuzberg was isolated . its eastern parts were almost entirely surrounded by the wall . this area consequently had cheap rents and lower-income families as well as squatters from the radical left . the western part of kreuzberg also bordered onto the wall , and it was here where checkpoint charlie was .
