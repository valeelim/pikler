Caliphate     a caliphate ( `` khilāfa '' ) is an area containing an islamic steward known as a caliph ( `` '' ) —a person considered a religious successor to the islamic prophet , muhammad ( muhammad ibn ʿabdullāh ) , and a leader of the entire muslim community . the rashidun caliphs , who directly succeeded muhammad as leaders of the muslim community , were chosen through `` shura , `` a process of community consultation that some consider loosely to be an early form of islamic democracy . during the history of islam after the rashidun period , many muslim states , almost all of them hereditary monarchies , have claimed to be caliphates . even though caliphs were thought to go back to muhammad , they were not thought of as having the same prophetic power as he did . the sunni branch of islam stipulates that , as a head of state , a caliph should be elected by muslims or their representatives . followers of shia islam , however , believe a caliph should be an imam chosen by god from the `` ahl al-bayt '' ( the `` family of the house '' , muhammad 's direct descendants ) .
