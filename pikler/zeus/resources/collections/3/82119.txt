Dvorak technique     the dvorak technique ( developed in 1974 by vernon dvorak ) is a widely used system to subjectively estimate tropical cyclone intensity based solely on visible and infrared satellite images . several agencies issue dvorak numbers for cyclones of sufficient intensity . these include the national hurricane center 's tropical analysis and forecast branch ( tafb ) , the noaa/nesdis satellite analysis branch ( sab ) , the joint typhoon warning center at the naval pacific meteorology and oceanography center in pearl harbor , hawaii , and the air force weather agency ( afwa ) . other websites . - agencies issuing dvorak intensity estimates - uw-cimss ( advanced dvorak technique ) - noaa/nesdis satellite analysis branch - air force weather agency - about the tafb - other - tropical cyclone intensity analysis and forecasting from satellite imagery dvorak , 1974 .
