Petal     a petal is a coloured part of a flower . with bright colours and scent , they often bring insects and birds to pollinate the flowers . petals are made of cellulose and other organic matter . petals are modified leaves which surround the reproductive parts of flowers . together , all of the petals of a flower are called a corolla . the role of petals and the evolution of flowers is an important part of botany . it has been studied from the 18th century to the present day . the most common types of pollination are : 1. wind pollination : flowers are small and dull , with little or no scent , and often no petals at all . they produce large amounts of pollen which is scattered by the wind . 1. insect pollination : flowers show well in the ultraviolet range , often have honey guides . these are lines leading from the petal to the nectar . use of scent is also common . 1. bird pollination : large , colourful flowers with nectar .
