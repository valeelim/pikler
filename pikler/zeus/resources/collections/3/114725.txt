Istrian-Dalmatian exodus     the expression istrian-dalmatian exodus is used to indicate the diaspora or forced migration of ethnic italians from istria , fiume , and dalmatia , after world war ii . those territories were ethnically mixed since the middle ages with a majority of italians , but even with slovenian , croatian , serbian and other communities . national memorial day of the exiles and foibe is italian celebration in memory of all exiles and victims in massacres of foibe : murdered and survived . istria including fiume ( rijeka ) and parts of dalmatia including zara ( zadar ) , had been annexed to italy after world war i. at the end of world war ii the former italian territories in istria and dalmatia became part of yugoslavia by the paris peace treaty ( 1947 ) , with the only exception being the communes of muggia and san dorligo della valle . italian sources claim that about 350,000 ethnic italians had to leave the areas in the aftermath of the conflict . official data shows that between 1948 and 1961 ( the `` exodus '' started in 1943 in dalmatia and in 1945 in the rest of the territory ) the numbers of ethnic italians living in slovenia - almost exclusively in slovenian istria and along the italian border - actually decreased by nearly -87 % ( from 25,451 to 3,072 ) . the data for the former yugoslavia shows a decrease in the same years from 113,278 to 25,615. according to slovenian historian matjaž klemenčič , `` in 1953 only 36,000 '' ( italians ) `` lived in the region of former yugoslavia , i.e . 16 % of the italian population before world war ii . italians also emigrated in later decades ( most of them to the australia , canada , south america or the usa ) . therefore their population declined in each subsequent census until 1981. we have to emphasize that the data of the yugoslav census are unrealiable in relation to the real number if italians , since many members of the italian minority , for various reasons , chose 'nationality undeclared ' or their regional identity ( most as 'istrians ' ) . in the 1991 census there was a relatively large increase of italians , '' ( 19,213 in the regions of autochthonous settlements of italians in croatia ) `` compared to 1981 census '' ( 15,132 ) . `` many italians who in previous census did not declare as such , declared themselves 'italians ' in 1991 because they counted on the help of italy in forthcoming crises in the region '' .
