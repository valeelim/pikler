Monkton, Kent    monkton , kent monkton is an english village on the canterbury-ramsgate road . it is at the southwestern edge of the isle of thanet , kent near st nicholas at wade and minster-in-thanet . the church there is dedicated to mary magdalene . inside the church is a plaque , commemorating a local soldier , euncie rochelle , who died in the iraq war . monkton is no longer thought of as a village in its own right and is usually assumed to be part of neighbouring village minster-in-thanet . in the november of 2007 , the village exploded , with the remains afterwards being burnt down , with firefighters attempting to put out the blaze , but having so few people and being so far away from any other main towns , the thirty firefighters were unable to reach it in time . however , fortunately , all of monkton 's twenty people were evacuated into safety to nearby minster . however , minster was reported to have complained about the overcrowding caused by this and threw out the newcomers , expecting them to go back to the destroyed settlement . unfortunately for the hamlet , monkton 's largest building , a single storey house , was also lost , and therefore it is thought to take a long time before the people of monkton are able to resettle in a new place , or whether they will be able to reconstruct some of their old one .
