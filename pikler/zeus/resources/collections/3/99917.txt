S/2004 S 3     even though later astronomers tried to find it again , it has not been reliably seen since . notably , an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 november , 2004 failed to find the object . this suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time . another object , , was seen nearby 5 hours later , but this time just `` inside '' the f ring . because of the different location of the second object , it was given a fresh designation , although their interpretation as a single object on a f-ring crossing orbit is also possible . such an object might also be orbiting at a bit different inclination to the f ring , thereby not actually passing through the ring material even though it was being seen both radially inward and outward of it . if a solid object after all , would be 3âˆ’5 km in diameter based on brightness , and might be a shepherd satellite for the farther edge of saturn 's f ring . other websites . - cassini-huygens press release about discoveries around the f ring in 2004
