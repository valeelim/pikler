Embargo     an embargo is when a government refuses to trade with a country or a certain part of a country . this is usually because of a political problem inside the country . it differs from a blockade in not requiring a state of war or obliging other countries to stop trading . as with other economic sanctions , an embargo stops trade between countries . this means that the countries in question will get poorer . the hope is that the problem within the country will stop .
