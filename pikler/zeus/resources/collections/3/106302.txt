Partsong     a partsong is a piece of music to be sung by two or more voices without accompaniment . many partsongs are written for four voices : normally soprano , alto , tenor and bass . such a partsong can be performed just by four people , but it can also be performed by a larger group ( a choir ) which has divided into these four parts . the term `` partsong '' can refer to music such as a glee , madrigal or unaccompanied anthem , but it is usually used in english when talking about short , secular ( non-religious ) songs without accompaniment . in other languages there is no word which means quite the same thing . partsongs were very popular in the 17th century in england . they were often fun pieces to be sung at parties or in pubs . they were often rounds , catches or quodlibets . in the 19th century the madrigal came into fashion again and so many composers started writing partsongs . composers such as sterndale bennett , arthur sullivan , parry , charles villiers stanford and edward elgar wrote many partsongs , and later finzi , john ireland and moeran .
