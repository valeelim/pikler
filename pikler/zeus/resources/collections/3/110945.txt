Ophthalmosaurus     ophthalmosaurus was an ichthyosaur of the upper jurassic ( 165 to 150 million years ago ) , named after its large eyes . well-preserved skeletons , ranging in age from juveniles to adults , have been found in europe , north america and argentina . `` ophthalmosaurus '' had the largest eyes of any vertebrate `` relative to its body size '' . its eyes , 4 inches in diameter , occupied most of the space in the skull . they were protected by bony plates ( sclerotic rings ) , which most likely assisted to maintain the shape of the eyeballs against water pressure at depth . the size of the eyes and the sclerotic rings suggests that `` ophthalmosaurus '' hunted at a depth where there is not much light or that it may have hunted at night when a prey species was more active . its snout was long and thin , perfect for snapping at fast , maneuverable , prey . calculations suggest that a typical `` ophthalmosaurus '' could stay submerged for approximately 20 minutes or more . the swimming speed of `` ophthalmosaurus '' has been estimated at 2.5 metres per second or greater . even assuming a conservative speed of 1 m/s , an `` ophthalmosaurus '' would be able to dive to 600 meters and return to the surface within 20 minutes .
