Waterspout     a waterspout is a funnel cloud over water . it is a nonsupercell tornado over water . waterspouts do `` not '' suck up water ; the water seen in the main funnel cloud is actually water droplets formed by condensation . it is weaker than most of its land counterparts . waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm , are known as `` nontornadic '' or `` fair-weather waterspouts '' , and are by far the most common type . fair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark , flat-bottomed , developing convective cumulus towers . a winter waterspout , also known as a snow devil , an icespout , an ice devil , a snonado , or a snowspout , is a very rare meteorological phenomenon in which a vortex from snow develops that looks like a waterspout . one does not know much about this rare happening and there are only six known pictures of this event so far . there are three main things that produce a winter waterspout : - very cold temperatures present over a body of warm water enough to produce fog that looks like steam above the water 's surface . this usually needs temperatures of -18 °c or colder if the water temperature is no warmer than 5 °c .
