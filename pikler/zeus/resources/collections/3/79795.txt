Carburization     carburization ( often also called carburizing ) is the process by which carbon is introduced into a metal . it is done to make the surface harder and more abrasion resistant . depending on the amount of time and temperature , the affected area can vary in carbon content . in earlier times , direct application of charcoal was packed onto the metal for carburization . modern techniques use carbon-bearing gases or plasmas ( such as carbon dioxide or methane ) . carburization is mainly used to harden the surface of low alloy steel . too great a concentration of carbon makes metal brittle and unworkable , so then metals may be decarburized .
