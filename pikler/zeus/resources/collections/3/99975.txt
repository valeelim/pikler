Warp drive     warp drive ( also called warp technology ) is hypothetical technology created in science fiction . it is a way of moving objects faster than the speed of light . there are many examples of how this idea is used . a well-known one is found in the `` star trek '' universe , where faster-than-light travel is needed to tell the story . current technology does not allow anything or anyone to go at , or faster than , the speed of light . unless the current theories are proven wrong , this will always be true . however warp technology as a fictional idea has been an interesting way of shaping the story line to let spaceships move at speeds greater than 186,000 miles per second ( speed of light through a vacuum - the known limit of speed in the universe ) . warp technology , as the name implies , 'warps space ' in effect bringing a destination closer by bending space rather than the traditional 'thruster ' means of propelling a space craft at high speeds . warp technology allows ships move at warp speed . in the `` star trek '' universe , for example , the measurement of the speed that the spaceship is moving is called the warp factor . however , thrusters and impulse power propel spaceships at sub-light speed . warp factor 1 is equal to the speed of light . the speed ranges up to warp factor 9.99. in some circumstances `` star trek '' spaceships can go faster than warp 10 , although rare .
