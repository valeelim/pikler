Convergent evolution     convergent evolution is a process in biology . it occurs when two species from unrelated lines develop the same traits or features . this happens because they live in similar habitats , and have to develop solutions to the same kind of problems . similarity in traits can occur in two ways . both species might have acquired the trait by descent from a common ancestor . in this case the structures are homologous . an example is the tetrapod limb , which has been inherited from early tetrapods in the late devonian/early carboniferous , about 360 million years ago . on the other hand , both might be independent adaptations to similar conditions in their habitat . in this case the structures are analogous . convergent evolution leads to analogous features . examples . - wings : the wings of insects , birds , bats and pterosaurs are similar to a certain degree . in particular , they are all thin and strong , with a wide surface area . the wings can be mechanically moved in a regular way so as to create lift ; and so on . in each case the wings evolved separately , so their form reflects certain physical necessities . the three larger animals all have insulation and temperature regulation , and hence a high rate of metabolism . that is also necessary for flight , which requires a great deal of energy .
