Mid-Atlantic States     the mid-atlantic states ( also called `` middle atlantic states '' or simply `` middle east '' ) form one of the nine geographic divisions within the united states that are officially recognized by the united states census bureau . the division consists of three states : new jersey , new york , and pennsylvania . this definition corresponds with the region 's traditional definition as the section of the atlantic seaboard between new england and the south . however , many people consider the mid-atlantic to be the states south of the northeast , centered in delaware , maryland . the traditional mid-atlantic states comprise the most densely-populated of the nine u.s. regions , and anchor the megalopolis which runs from boston to washington , d.c.. the southeastern part of new york state , eastern pennsylvania , and all of new jersey combine to form the bulk of the `` moral region '' of the metropolis , according to socio-political geographers james patterson and peter kim , co-authors of the 1991 book `` the day america told the truth '' . ( metropolis begins in the southern connecticut suburbs of new york city and stretches along the eastern seaboard to the northern virginia suburbs of washington , d.c. ) . the book classifies the remainder of new york state and pennsylvania in the rust belt .
