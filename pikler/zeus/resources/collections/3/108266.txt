Anti-nuclear movement in Australia     australia has no nuclear power stations and the rudd labor government was opposed to nuclear power for australia . however , australia does have a small research reactor ( opal ) in sydney , and it does export uranium . uranium mining and export and nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate , and the anti-nuclear movement in australia has a long history . it began with the 1972–73 debate over french nuclear testing in the pacific , which involved several groups , and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in australia . the case against nuclear power and uranium mining in australia has been concerned with the impacts of nuclear energy ; with the shortcomings of nuclear power as an energy source ; and with presenting a sustainable energy strategy . the most prominent adverse impact of nuclear power is seen to be its potential contribution towards proliferation of nuclear weapons . for example , the 1976 ranger inquiry report stated that `` the nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war . this is the most serious hazard associated with the industry '' .
