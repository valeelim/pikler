Organic light-emitting diode     organic light-emitting diode ( oled ) is a type of light-emitting diode ( led ) . the part of the oled that creates light is made of a very thin layer of organic compounds . the main use of oled technology is for flat panel displays for smartphones and other mobile devices where they are in some ways better than lcds . oleds can be used to make displays that can bend . these can be used in many different ways . for example , they can be used in clothing . lcds are in some ways better than oleds and some ways worse . oleds can make more colors and levels of brightness than leds . unlike lcds their colors do not change when viewed at an angle . they are also much cheaper to make . oleds make light , so they do not need a light shining through from the back as lcds do . lcds also need to use filters to work properly . these filters block much of the light created by the led/ccfl . because of backlighting and filtering , oleds use far less power than lcds for the amount of light made . oleds also react faster to changes in electricity . they turn on and off much faster than lcds .
