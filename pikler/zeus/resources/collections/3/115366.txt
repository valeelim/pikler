Abbasid Caliphate     the abbasid caliphate was the third of the four great muslim caliphates of the arab empire . it overthrew the umayyad caliphs from all but al-andalus . it was built by the descendant of muhammad 's youngest uncle , abbas ibn abd al-muttalib . it was created in harran in 750 of the christian era and shifted its capital in ad 762 from harran to baghdad . it flourished for two centuries . abbasid rule was ended in 1258 , when hulagu khan , the mongol conqueror , sacked baghdad . but they continued to claim authority in religious matters from their base in egypt . during the period of the abassid dynasty , abassid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged . the ubayd allah al-mahdi billah of the fatimid dynasty , which claimed descendency of muhammad through his daughter , claimed the title of caliph in 909 and created a separate line of caliphs in north africa . initially it covered only morocco , algeria , tunisia and libya , but then the fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years , taking egypt and palestine and even ancient pakistan , before the abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide , limiting fatimid rule to egypt . the fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171. the umayyad dynasty , which had survived and come to rule over the muslim provinces of spain , reclaimed the title of caliph in 929 , lasting until it was overthrown in 1031 .
