Analog signal     an analog or analogue signal is any continuous signal . the difference from a digital signal is that also very small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful . when one speaks of analog one often means an electrical context , however mechanical , pneumatic , hydraulic , and other systems may also convey analog signals . an analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal 's information . any information may be conveyed by an analog signal , often such a signal is a measured change in physical phenomena , such as sound , light , temperature , position , or pressure . for example , in sound recording , changes in air pressure ( that is to say , sound ) strike the diaphragm of a microphone which causes related changes in a voltage or the current in an electric circuit . the voltage or the current is said to be an `` analog '' of the sound . see digital for a discussion of `` digital vs. analog '' .
