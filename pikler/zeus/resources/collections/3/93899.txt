Mendelian inheritance     mendelian inheritance is a set of rules about genetic inheritance . the basic rules of genetics were first discovered by a monk named gregor mendel in the 1850s , and published in 1866. for thousands of years , people had noticed how traits are inherited from parents to their children . however , mendel 's work was different because he did experiments on plants , and designed those experiments very carefully . in his experiments , mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants . he started his crosses with plants that bred true , and counted characters that were either/or in nature ( either `` tall '' or `` short '' ) . he bred large numbers of plants , and expressed his results numerically . he used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters . mendel 's laws apply widely , but not to all living things . they apply to any organism which is diploid ( has two paired sets of chromosomes ) and which engages in sexual reproduction . they would not apply to bacteria , for example , or to asexual reproduction . they do apply to the great majority of plants and animals .
