Silt     silt is soil or rock that developed from granular material of a specific grain size . silt particles range between a and mm ( 3.9 to 62.5 Î¼m ) , larger than clay but smaller than a sand . silt is chemically distinct from clay , and unlike clay , grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions . silt may occur as a soil or alternatively as suspended sediment in a water column of any surface water body . it may also exist as deposition soil at the bottom of a water body and it can occur as a deposit or as material transported by a stream or by a current in the ocean . silt is easily transported in water and is fine enough to be carried long distances by air as 'dust ' . thick deposits of silty material that result from `` wind '' deposition are often called `` loess '' ( a german term ) or `` limon '' ( french ) . silt and clay contribute to in water .
