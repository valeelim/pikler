Xfce     xfce ( ) is a free software desktop environment for unix and other unix-like platforms , such as linux , solaris and bsd . it is made to be fast and lightweight , while still looking nice and easy to use . the current version , 4.12 , is modular and reusable . it is based on the gtk+ 2 toolkit ( formerly used in gnome ) . it uses the xfwm window manager , described below . its configuration is entirely mouse-driven , and the configuration files are hidden from the casual user . olivier fourdan started the project in 1996. the name `` xfce '' originally stood for `` xforms common environment '' , but after that xfce has been rewritten twice and no longer uses that toolkit . the name survived , but it is no longer capitalized as `` xfce '' , but rather as `` xfce '' . starting with version 4.2 , the window manager of xfce , xfwm , integrates its own `` compositing manager '' . other compositing managers exist , but have been very unstable , and xfce was the first to put its own compositing manager into the window manager . at its beginning , many users called it the most stable one available , though at the time , in late 2004 , xcompmgr was the only other compositing manager available .
