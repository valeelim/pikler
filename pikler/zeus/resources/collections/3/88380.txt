Antoine Busnois     antoine busnois ( pronounce `` an-twun bew-nwah '' ) ( also spelt busnoys ) ( born about 1430 ; died 6 november 1492 ) was a french composer and poet of the early renaissance burgundian school . he wrote church music , such as motets , as well as ( non-religious ) chansons . he was the most important composer of the late burgundian school after the death of guillaume dufay . we do not know where busnois was born . it might have been in the tiny village of business in the artois district . maybe he took his name from the village . nothing is known about his musical education . we know that he got into trouble in 1461 because he was said to be in a group of people who beat up a priest on five occasions . at that time he was a chaplain in tours cathedral . while the attack was being investigated he went to mass . this led to him being excommunicated , but later the pope pardoned him . in 1465 he moved from the cathedral to the collegiate church of st. martin , also in tours , where he became a subdeacon . johannes ockeghem was treasurer there , and the two composers seem to have known each other well . later in 1465 busnois moved to poitiers , where he not only became `` ma√Ætrise '' ( master of the choirboys ) , but managed to get lots of good singers from the region . by this time he was famous as a singing teacher and composer . however he left the job for some reason in 1466 and then moved to burgundy .
