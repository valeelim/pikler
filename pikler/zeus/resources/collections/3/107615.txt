Zircon     zircon is a silicate mineral . it is found in many different places in almost all kinds of rock . the chemical it is made up of is called `` zirconium silicate '' : zrsio . clear zircon may look like diamond and has been used as a cheaper replacement for diamond . it is not the same as cubic zirconia , which is man-made zirconium dioxide . in the united states , zircon is considered to be the birth stone for the month of december . zircons from the jack hills in the narryer gneiss terrane , yilgarn craton , western australia , have yielded u–pb ( uranium–lead radioactive dating ) ages up to 4.404 billion years . this is judged to be the age of crystallization , making them the oldest minerals so far dated on earth . in addition , the oxygen isotopic compositions of some of these zircons indicate that more than 4.4 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the earth . this interpretation is supported by additional trace element data , but is also the subject of debate .
