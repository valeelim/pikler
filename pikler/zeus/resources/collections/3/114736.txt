Italian cultural and historic presence in Dalmatia     italian cultural and historic presence in dalmatia is related to the italian influence in dalmatia ( now divided between croatia , herzegovina and montenegro ) from the historical and cultural points of view . the historical influence from the italian peninsula in dalmatia started with the roman conquest of illyrian dalmatia . the historian theodore mommsen stated in his book `` history of rome '' that all dalmatia was fully romanised and latin speaking by the fourth century . the actual dalmatians may in part trace their origins back to the romanised illyrians during the `` barbarian invasions '' of the fifth and sixth centuries when avars with some slavs invaded illyria . this invasion opened the way to the settlement of different slavic tribes ( mainly the `` croats '' ) . during those years the original latin population took refuge in the coastal cities and in the islands , whilst other migrated to the mountains ( they were later called `` morlachs '' ) . so , in the early middle ages , the coastal area of dalmatia retained its original latinized culture , mainly on the islands and cities such as zara , spalato , ragusa and cattaro . these cities during the middle ages were called `` citta ' marittime di dalmazia '' ( dalmatian maritime neolatin cities ) and maintained deep cultural and commercial links with the italian mainland , thanks to intense commerce through the adriatic sea .
