Transubstantiation     transubstantiation is a teaching , and also a catholic doctrine , which says that , after a priest consecrates them , the bread and wine at the mass become the body and blood of jesus , whom christians believe is the son of god . according to the teaching of transubstantiation , although the appearance , smell , and taste of bread and wine remain , the substances of bread and wine have really changed into the body and blood of jesus . transubstantiation is also taught by some other christian churches . christians who believe in transubstantiation believe that the bread they eat at mass is the body of jesus . they know that the bread still tastes like bread , looks like bread and smells like bread . it is just like bread , but it becomes the body of jesus . the priest says prayers at mass so that the bread and wine become the flesh and blood of jesus . this started when jesus ate a meal called the last supper the night before he died . he said that the food his friends were eating was his body and blood . in the gospel of matthew 26:26 , it says , `` take this [ bread ] all of you and eat it . this is my body which will be given up for you , '' which means that he would die for them . then , in matthew 26:27 , jesus said , `` take this [ cup ] all of you and drink from it . this is the cup of my blood , the blood of the new and everlasting covenant . '' this means that jesus 's blood would make a promise forever between god and his people . then he said , `` my blood will be shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgiven . '' this means that jesus would die for everyone so their sins , or things they do wrong , could be forgiven . then he said , `` do this in memory of me . '' this is jesus commanding people to continue what he did . from that time until now , people have continued what jesus did and it reminds them of the last supper .
