Book of Jonah     the old testament book of jonah , contains four chapters , and forty-eight verses . the book tells the story of the prophet jonah , who was called by god to the heathen city of nineveh , which god would soon destroy if they did not repent . after his first rejection , jonah was swallowed by a great fish ( probably a whale ) . he repented of his sin of running away from god through prayer for three days and nights . god then made the great fish spit jonah onto the dry land . he obeyed god and went to tell the people of their sins to god . they nearly had him killed . but that was before their hearts were changed and they saw their evildoing . they prayed for god to deliver them from the upcoming destruction to their city . god saw their change and had mercy on them , but jonah still did not believe it . he would than wait upon a high up rock and await god 's wrath . god was not pleased with that and sent a small worm to bite down the small gourd plant , which was jonah 's only shade from the heat of the sun . he was very angry and said it was better for him to die than live . god , in turn , said that he cared more about the little plant than all the people of nineveh !
