Central Collegiate Hockey Association     the central collegiate hockey association ( ccha ) was a group of colleges and universities , mostly in the midwestern united states plus one in alaska , that played ncaa division i hockey against one another every season . the conference , formed in 1971 , folded after the 2012–13 season . the end for the ccha came after the big ten conference , home to three of the ccha 's most important members ( michigan , michigan state , and ohio state ) , announced in 2011 that it would start a men 's hockey league in the 2013–14 season . soon after the big ten announcement , a group of six schools—five from the western collegiate hockey association ( wcha ) plus ccha member miami ( ohio ) —formed the national collegiate hockey conference ( nchc ) , which began play in 2013–14 . within a few months , all of the other ccha schools said they would also leave , with western michigan joining the nchc , notre dame joining hockey east , and the rest joining the wcha . the conference only sponsored men 's ice hockey—only one of the ccha 's 11 final members had a varsity women 's hockey team , namely ohio state . the champion was automatically invited to the ncaa division i men 's hockey tournament .
