SuperDisk     ls-120 or superdisk is a high-speed , high-capacity alternative to the 90 mm ( 3.5 in ) , 1.44 mb floppy disk . it is called high density media . the main advantage when compared to fdd and zd is the possibility to use the united mechanism for these special diskettes even for fdd and zd . this superdisk was introduced by iomega in 1995 as zd . but the superdisks were not expanded because of slowness and unreliability in comparison with zd . superdisk 120mb diskettes may still be available in the marketplace , however are no longer warranted . we do not have information about where these products can be purchased . once a drive fails , it may be impossible or expensive to get data off the diskettes . superdisk diskettes are etched with a servo pattern at the factory . this pattern is then read by the superdisk drive to precisely align the read/write head . the result is that a superdisk diskette can have 2,490 tracks , as opposed to the 160 tracks that conventional 3.5-inch 1.44 mb diskettes use .
