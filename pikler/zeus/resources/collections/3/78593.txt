Pedogenesis     pedogenesis or soil evolution ( formation ) is the process by which soil is formed . climate regulates soil formation . soils are more developed in areas with higher rainfall and more warmth . the rate of chemical weathering increases by 2-3 times when the temperature increases by 10 degrees celsius ( 20 Â°f ) . climate also affects which organisms are present , affecting the soil chemically and physically ( movement of roots , burrowing by animals ) . the organisms living in and on the soil form distinct soil types . coniferous forests have acidic leaf litter . mixed or deciduous forests leave a larger layer of humus . prairies have very high humus accumulation , creating a dark , thick soil . the rock from which soil is formed is called 'parent material ' ( bedrock ) . the main types are : eolian ( wind ) , glacial material , alluvium , lake material other parent materials . pedogenesis is the major topic of the science of pedology . its other aspects include the soil morphology , classification ( taxonomy ) of soils , and their distribution in nature .
