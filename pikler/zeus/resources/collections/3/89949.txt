Sukarno     sukarno ( 6 june 1901 â€“ 21 june 1970 ) was the first president of indonesia . he helped the country win its independence from the netherlands . he was president from 1945 to 1967 , presiding with mixed success over the country 's rough switch to independence . sukarno was forced to resign by one of his generals , suharto . suharto formally became president in march 1967. the spelling `` sukarno '' has been official in indonesia since 1947. it is still common to see the older spelling soekarno , mainly because he signed his name with the old spelling . official indonesian presidential decrees from 1947-1968 , however , printed his name using the 1947 spelling . indonesians also remember him as bung '' karno or pak '' karno . like many javanese people , he had only one name ; in religious contexts , he was occasionally referred to as 'achmad sukarno ' .
