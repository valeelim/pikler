Tickling     tickling is to lightly scratch , touch , or rub a person or animal to make them laugh . some think it causes pleasure and happiness . other people hate it . tickle spots are feet , armpits and sides of stomach . it is believed by many that tickling yourself is very hard and by some that it is nearly impossible . research shows that the brain notices and senses our movements and actions . this lets the brain prepare itself when we try to tickle ourselves . the unexpected senses are then cancelled by our brain so we do n't feel the reaction we would have if someone else tickled us when we least expected it . unlike others , some people in the world know how to tickle themselves . this is because they know the tickling spots in their body and are able to use other objects to tickle themselves . for example , they can use a piece of tissue and rub it against their stomach to tickle themselves .
