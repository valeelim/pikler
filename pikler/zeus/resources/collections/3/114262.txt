Homo heidelbergensis     homo heidelbergensis ( `` heidelberg man '' ) is the name given to a number of human fossil remains that are older than fossils of neanderthals . `` homo heidelbergensis '' is abbreviated h. heidelbergensis . scientists are not sure whether these remains are from a distinct species . they are fragments ( small pieces of bones ) , and most can not be dated exactly . in the older texts they were simply called archaic humans or `` early `` homo sapiens . '' '' there have been relatively well-defined remains of `` homo erectus '' found in africa from very early in human history . there have also been well-defined remains of `` homo neanderthalensis '' found in europe from later in history . some scholars use the terms `` archaic humans , '' `` early `` homo sapiens , '' '' or `` homo heidelbergensis '' to describe remains that seem to come from between these two periods in history . some authors use it for all early species of `` homo '' , including neanderthals . in 1907 , an archaeologist found a fossil of a lower jaw in mauer , near heidelberg , germany . some scientists thought this lower jaw was so different from any other species that it belonged to an undiscovered species . they named this species `` homo heidelbergensis '' .
