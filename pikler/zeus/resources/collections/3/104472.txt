Australian megafauna     australian megafauna is a word used to describe a number of animal species in australia that are quite a bit bigger than their closest living relatives . these species became extinct during the pleistocene ( 16,100Â±100 - 50,000 years before present ) , but exact dates for their extinction have only been discovered recently . scientists have been unable to agree on the reasons the megafauna became extinct . it is possible when humans came to australia ( around 48,000-60,000 years ago ) , and began hunting and using fire , they may have caused the extinction of the megafauna . climate change , which made the country much drier during an ice age about 18,000 years ago , may have also have led to the extinction of the megafauna . some scientists say that climate change alone caused the extinction of the megafauna . this argument does not allow for the fact that the megafaunal species had lived through two million years of climate changes . they had lived through a number of dry times before their sudden extinction .
