Single person     a person is called single if he or she is not married . in a more general sense , the word also means that person currently has no exclusive partner , like a boyfriend or girlfriend . such people can be classified into different types : - people who choose to live alone . this includes hermits and shamans . the catholic church does not want that their priests marry . there are also some restrictions in the orthodox church . nuns and monks are also not allowed to marry . such singles are often part of a religious order or community . - people who live alone because of social norms . this was especially true for children who were born outside a marriage , in the middle ages . - people who have not yet found their partner . some people actively search for a mate , others simply wait until the right person comes along . - people whose partner died , or who are divorced . in english , male singles used to be called `` bachelors '' , female singles used to be called `` spinsters '' ( or `` bachelorettes '' , more recently ) . in general , the word `` single '' is used more often now , because it also does not make a difference between the two sexes .
