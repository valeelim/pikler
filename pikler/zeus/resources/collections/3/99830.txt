Mosaic     mosaic is the art of decorating a surface with pictures and patterns made of little pieces of stone , glass or tiles of different colours . mosaics can be used indoors on walls , floors and ceilings of pools and malls . they are sometimes used outdoors on pavements . mosaics are made by setting coloured pieces into `` mortar '' ( cement ) which sets hard and holds the pieces in place . some mosaics are made of round pebbles , and have only two or three colours . other mosaics are made of marble . many mosaics , particularly in italy , are made of terracotta tiles . ( terracotta is `` fired '' clay that has been baked in an oven . ) terracotta tiles come in many colours and can be used for colourful pictures as well as patterns . some tiles look as if they are made of pure gold . these tiles are actually made of glass and have a very thin `` leaf '' of gold stuck to one side . the side with the gold gets put into the mortar . then the gold can be seen through the glass , but can not be scratched off . mosaics often last for a very long time . there are still plenty of mosaics which were made by the ancient romans . they can be seen in italy , england , france , as well as other countries that were once part of the roman empire .
