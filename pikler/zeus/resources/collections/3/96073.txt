Over-harvesting     over-harvesting means taking more from the land ( or sea ) than it can replace . it includes extreme farming , grazing , fishing , and using fresh water . over-harvesting is harmful in the long term . forests or wetlands are hard to replace . damage to nature hurts animals and humans . most wetlands are damaged by overuse as a source of drinking water , and are sometimes drained to make farmland or land for building . a thriving and diverse ecosystem is destroyed . over-harvesting also applies to animals . population numbers may drop as a result , and species may become extinct . overfishing is a typical example . nowadays , you can only fish , shoot deer or birds at certain times of the year . the season when they mate , reproduce and lay eggs or have the young are protected . areas of especial natural beauty or scientific interest are also protected . taking bird eggs is also now against the law , at least in the united kingdom . one thing which acts against conservation is the overpopulation of the world . the greatest single reason why the world loses forests is that some people want the land for other purposes . a few people gain , but everyone shares the cost . this is called the tragedy of the commons .
