Finite element method     the finite element method is a numerical method of solving systems of differential equations . they are used extensively in many fields of engineering because they require very little knowledge of mathematics beyond basic algebra to use . it belongs to the methods of weighted residuals in that the problem is formulated such that some conditions are satisfied exactly , while others are satisfied only approximately or numerically ( i.e. , the `` residual '' being the difference between the exact solution and the approximate solution is weighted and minimized to get the best approximation ) . while the ease of setting up a problem using finite elements and getting a solution is the reason for its popularity , it is also the cause of its frequent misuse and distrust of the answers obtained . usually you have to check your results with an experiment before your model is acceptable for use . it is the author 's observation that the use of finite elements in structural analysis is in particular poorly managed . engineers typically begin working with fe having very little knowledge of numerical methods or knowledge of finite element behavior . there are no standards and guidelines for modeling and few managers who understand well enough to regulate modeling . it has led to mistrust of the method , its arrested development , and some very bad analysis being performed that is copied by others . much aircraft structural design is analyzed using fe .
