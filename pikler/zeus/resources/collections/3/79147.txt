Blood type     blood type or blood group is a medical term . it describes the type of blood a person has . it is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells ( rbcs ) . blood types predict whether a serious reaction will occur in a blood transfusion . this reaction is called a `` haemolytic reaction '' . it may destroy red blood cells , and cause renal failure . shock is likely to occur , and death is a possibility . when a blood transfusion or an organ transplant takes place , it is vital to know the blood types of the donor ( who gives blood ) and the receiver ( who needs blood ) . there are a number of human blood group systems . of these systems , the abo blood group system and the rhesus blood group system are the most important . in this system the presence or absence of the a-antigen , the b-antigen and the rhd-antigen are determined . the principle of the abo system is that antigens – in this instance , sugars exposed on the surface of red blood cells – differ between individuals . people have immunological tolerance only for what occurs in their own bodies . as a result , humans may produce antibodies against natural components in the bodies of `` other '' people , but not themselves . so , people may produce antibodies against a and/or b antigens if they are not in their blood .
