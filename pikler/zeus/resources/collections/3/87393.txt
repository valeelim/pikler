Wave–particle duality     wave–particle duality is perhaps one of the most confusing concepts in physics , because it is so unlike anything we see in the ordinary world . physicists who studied light in the 1700s and 1800s were having a big argument about whether light was made of particles shooting around like tiny bullets , or waves washing around like water waves . light seems to do both . at times , light seems to go only in a straight line , as if it were made of particles . but other experiments show that light has a frequency and wavelength , just like a sound wave or water wave . until the 20th century , most physicists thought that light was either one or the other , and that the scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong . in 1909 , a scientist named geoffrey taylor decided that he was going to settle this argument once and for all . he borrowed an experiment invented earlier by thomas young , where light was shone through two small holes right next to each other . when bright light was shone through these two small holes , it created an `` interference pattern '' that seemed to show that light was actually a wave .
