Virtualization     virtualization ( or virtualisation ) is a word used in computing . virtualization means that the users ( programs , or real people ) only see an abstraction of a computer resource . virtualization can be done in software , or with hardware . - raid . raid is used to virtualize computer storage . a raid system appears as one `` disk '' . the fact that it is made of several disks that work together is hidden . - virtual memory makes it possible to use more memory than is physically in the computer . the computer figures out a way to write contents of certain memory blocks to disk . - storage virtualization takes the ideas developed by raid further . this is what storage area networks commonly use . all the storage appears as a single big disk . certain administrators can specify that this large disk is made of `` data pools '' ( which are also virtual ) . the disk pools are made of single physical disks ( or raid arrays ) . - some computers ( mostly mainframes ) allow to run several operating systems at the same time . each operating system believes it is the only one running .
