Albatross     albatrosses are large seabirds which belong to the biological family diomedeidae . they live in the region of the southern ocean and the north pacific ocean . they are not found in the north atlantic region , but their fossils have been found there , which shows that they used to live there . there are four main species of albatross : great albatrosses , north pacific albatrosses , mollymawks and sooty albatrosses . these are divided into twenty-one species identified by the world conservation union ( icun ) . great albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds . all albatrosses are very good at flying , spending much of their life in the air . they eat squid , fish and krill . albatrosses come ashore to make their nests , mostly on islands , and usually near the nests of other birds . nineteen of the twenty-one species of albatross are endangered . this is partly because animals such as rats and cats attack their eggs , chicks , and sometimes adult birds as well . pollution of the oceans , such as plastic waste and oils spills , also kills albatrosses . sometimes there may be not enough fish to eat because of over-fishing . the main reason why albatross are endangered is longline fishing which causes many albatross to get caught on hooks that have been baited to catch fish . this causes the birds to drown .
