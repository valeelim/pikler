Carbohydrate     carbohydrates are chemical compounds that contain `` only '' oxygen , hydrogen and carbon . they are made up of joined-up sugars . sugars have the general formula c ( ho ) , and are also known as saccharides . certain carbohydrates are an important storage and transport form of energy in most organisms , including plants and animals . there are four types of carbohydrates , named by the number of sugar molecules they contain . 1. simple saccharides with one or two sugar molecules 1. monosaccharides : single sugar e.g . glucose , fructose 1. disaccharides : two saccharides . e.g . sucrose , lactose 1. longer chain saccharides : 1. oligosaccharides ( shortish chains ) , often linked to amino acids or lipids . they play a special role in cell membranes . 1. polysaccharides ( long chains ) are complex carbohydrates , with linear chains of sugars or branched clusters . their function is either energy storage ( starch , glycogen ) or building structures ( cellulose , chitin ) . carbohydrates are the most common source of energy for the human body . protein builds tissue and cells in the body . carbohydrates are very good for energy , but , if a person eats more than needed , the extra is changed into fat .
