Rings of Saturn     the rings of saturn are the planetary rings around the planet saturn , which can be seen with a small telescope . they consist of many small particles , ranging in size from microscopic to the size of a bus ( or bigger ) that form clumps that move around saturn . the particles in the rings are made almost entirely of water ice , with just a small amount of dust and other chemicals . there are some gaps in the rings . the moon pan causes the gap called the `` encke gap '' in saturn 's a ring . the `` cassini division '' , discovered by giovanni domenico cassini , is a gap between the a ring and the b ring . it is a product of orbital resonance .
