Higher education     higher education is after secondary education . through attending college a higher degree ( or title ) can be gained . generally , you must be 18 years old or over to enter higher education , having completed primary school and secondary education first . usually some kind of selection is used . exams can be of state , local or university level . sometimes no selection exists . some open universities encourage older adults to apply , whether they were good at school or not . higher education is either professional or academic . you can study for a diploma or a degree . graduates can study for a masters or doctorate . places of higher education were traditionally called universities , but there are other names like institute , teaching training college , academy , conservatory , and polytechnic . ( the names depend on the country ) . research work is done at this level . colleges often also reach out to employers and offer cultural or sporting events open to the local community . the importance of higher education in society changes according to the country ; for example , in many countries a student goes to university to obtain a diploma for work , but university is also often a time during which the student learns to be independent . students also learn to mix with people of different origins , and to grow as people . richer students can study in a place far from their hometown , but kids from poor neighbourhoods may be unable to afford college at all without a scholarship of some kind .
