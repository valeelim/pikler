Industrialization     industrialization ( or industrialisation ) is a process that happens in countries when they start to use machines to do work that was once done by people . industrialization changes the society as it happens . during the industrialisation of a country people leave farming work to take higher paid jobs in factories in towns . industrialization is part of a process where people adopt easier and cheaper ways to make things . using better technology , it becomes possible to produce more goods in a shorter amount of time . a single person can produce more things . after industrialization people also do more specialized jobs . for example before industrialization , a cobbler made the whole shoe . he worked on one pair of shoes , finished that , and then did the next pair of shoes . with industrialization , there are many people involved in making shoes . an individual shoemaker has a smaller task , however . there is one person that cuts the sole of the shoe . another person stitches it on . in short there is division of labour . the machines to make the shoes cost a lot of money so the factory will be owned by a rich person who can afford the machines .
