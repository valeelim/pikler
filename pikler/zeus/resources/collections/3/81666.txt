Himalia group     the himalia group is a group of prograde non-spherical moons of jupiter that follow similar orbits to himalia and are thought to have a common origin . the known members of the group are ( in order from closest to farthest from jupiter ) : - leda - himalia ( the biggest , which gives its name to the group ) - lysithea - elara the orbit estimate of the recently found moon s/2000 j 11 also qualified it as a member of the group ( it appeared to have the same inclination , and a slightly bigger semi-major axis ) but its orbit is not known exactly and the mean orbital elements have not yet been calculated . the international astronomical union ( iau ) reserves names in -a for the moons in this group . the objects in the himalia group have semi-major axes ( distances from jupiter ) in the range of 11,150,000 and 11,750,000 km , inclinations between 26.6° and 28.3° , and eccentricities of between 0.11 and 0.25. all moons in the group are grey similar to c-type asteroids . it has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the main asteroid belt . the radius of the parent asteroid was probably about 89 km , only a bit bigger than that of himalia , which retains approximately 87 % of the mass of the original body . this indicates the asteroid was not heavily disturbed .
