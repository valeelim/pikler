Inductor     an inductor is an electrical device used in electrical circuits because of magnetic charge . an inductor is usually made from a coil of conducting material , like copper wire , that is then wrapped around a core made from either air or a magnetic metal . if you use a more magnetic material as the core , you can get the magnetic field around the inductor to be pushed in towards the inductor , giving it better inductance . small inductors can also be put onto integrated circuits using the same ways that are used to make transistors . aluminum is usually used as the conducting material in this case . while a capacitor does not like changes in voltage , an inductor does not like changes in current . in general , the relationship between the time-varying voltage `` v '' ( `` t '' ) across an inductor with inductance `` l '' and the time-varying current `` i '' ( `` t '' ) passing through it is described by the differential equation : inductors are used often in analog circuits . two or more inductors that have coupled magnetic flux make a transformer . transformers are used in every power grid around the world .
