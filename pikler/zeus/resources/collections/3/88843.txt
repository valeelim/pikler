Tau     tau ( uppercase/lowercase τ τ ) , is the letter of the greek alphabet , used to represent the `` t '' sound in ancient and modern greek . in the system of greek numerals , it has a value of 300. letters that came from it include the roman t and cyrillic т. some people want to use tau in place of pi , the special number that comes from circles . tau would be equal to two times pi , or about 6.283. these people want to use tau because they think it would be easier for everyone to understand . there are many reasons in math why tau could be useful or helpful . one of the simplest is that it would make learning about radians easier . a radian is a way of measuring the angle of a circle . it says that the number of radians in an angle is equal to the length of the outside of the circle , or the 'arc length ' , that is covered by an angle , divided by the radius , or distance from the point in the center of a circle to anywhere on the outside . there is a picture down on the bottom right that shows this . if the distance covered around the outside of a circle is equal to the radius , than one radian is being covered . around the whole outside of a circle , there are about 6.283 radians - or , tau radians ( tau is just a number , like 0 , or 7 , or 100 ) .
