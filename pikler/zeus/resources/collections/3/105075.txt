D. B. Cooper     d. b. cooper ( also known as dan cooper ) is an alias ( false name ) for a man who hijacked an airplane in november 24 , 1971. at that time , airline passengers were not searched before boarding their planes . he carried a bomb onto a flight between portland , oregon and seattle , washington . he received the ransom payment of $ 200,000 . he jumped from the airplane , which was a boeing 727. when he jumped , the airplane was in the pacific northwest , perhaps over woodland , washington . hundreds of suspects have been named through the years , but no conclusive evidence has surfaced regarding who cooper was , or where he lived . the fbi believes he did not survive the jump . several people have tried to explain what happened after the jump . some of these explanations contradict each other . because no one expected he would jump and because little is known of what happened afterwards , people are still interested in the case . the cooper case ( code-named `` norjak '' by the fbi ) remains an unsolved mystery .
