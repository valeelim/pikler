Blank verse     the term blank verse means poetry that does not use rhyme . blank verse relies on the meter of the lines in the poem to give structure , and to create the feeling of poetry as compared to prose . an example from william wordsworth 's poem `` michael '' shows the lack of rhyme and the strict meter in blank verse â€“ each line sticks fairly closely to the pattern of iambic pentameter : many critics judge blank verse to be better than rhyme for serious subjects , and many poets have used blank verse for their most important works . shakespeare used rhyme in his early plays , but in his more mature works like `` hamlet '' he preferred blank verse . john milton wrote `` paradise lost '' in blank verse , including a note at the beginning of the poem saying that rhyming poetry was used to disguise badly written poems , and wordsworth used it for `` the prelude '' and `` the excursion '' . john keats used rhyme in his `` endymion '' , his first try at a major poem ; for his second attempt , `` hyperion '' , he switched to blank verse . the longest poems in english literature are written in blank verse , for example `` the fall of nineveh '' by edwin atherstone or `` king alfred '' by john fitchett . this last is about 130 000 lines long .
