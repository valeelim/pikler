Herbaceous plant     a herbaceous plant is a plant that does not have much wood and its stems are green and soft . these plants grow fast and produce flowers and many seeds in a short period of time . in botany , the word for a herbaceous plant is herb ( from latin `` herba '' , `` grass '' ) but it is common to use the word herb only for plants that are used in perfumes , medicines and for cooking , even if they are not herbaceous plants . herbaceous plants may be annuals , biennials or perennials but most are annuals and die at the end of their growing season ( the time when they produce flowers , fruits and seeds ) , leaving their seeds on the soil ; those seeds will produce new plants with good weather . wheat and pea are annual herbaceous plants . biennial and perennial herbaceous plants will live for two or more years but the stems that are in the air will die every year ; the underground stems will form the new aerial stems ( stems that are above the ground ) . underground roots and stems can resist more the bad weather ( winter or a very dry season ) than leaves and stems that are above the ground . bulbs are biennal and peonies are perennial herbaceous plants
