Gerhard Ertl     professor gerhard ertl is a german physicist in the department of physical chemistry of the fritz haber institute of the mpg . he was born on 10 october 1936 in stuttgart , germany . professor ertl won the nobel prize for chemistry in 2007. ertl ’ s research laid the foundation of modern surface chemistry , which has helped explain how fuel cells produce energy without pollution , how catalytic converters clean up car exhausts and even why iron rusts , the royal swedish academy of sciences said . his work has paved the way for development of cleaner energy sources and will guide the development of fuel cells , said astrid graslund , secretary of the nobel committee for chemistry . the nobel academy said ertl provided a detailed description of how chemical reactions take place on surfaces . his findings applied in both academic studies and industrial development , the academy said . “ surface chemistry can even explain the destruction of the ozone layer , as vital steps in the reaction actually take place on the surfaces of small crystals of ice in the stratosphere , ” the award citation reads .
