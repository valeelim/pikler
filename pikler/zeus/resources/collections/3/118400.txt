Books of Chronicles     the first and second chronicles are history books in the old testament . they tell the history of israel differently from the books of kings . using biblical books ( like samuel and kings ) and other sources , the `` chronicler '' encourages the jews who returned from exile in babylon . he goes back over israel 's history to explain why they have had all their troubles and how they can live right to become better in the future . originally , the first and second chronicles were one book . they were later split apart into two different books . the hebrew title ( `` dibre hayyamim '' ) means `` what happened in the days ( or years ) '' . the septuagint translators ( who translated the old testament into greek ) called the book `` the things left out '' . this showed that they thought of it as an addition to samuel and kings . jerome ( a.d. 347â€“420 ) , who translated the latin vulgate , said that a better title would be `` chronicle of the whole sacred history '' . luther used this idea in his german version , and others have followed him . chronicles was first divided into two books by the septuagint translators .
