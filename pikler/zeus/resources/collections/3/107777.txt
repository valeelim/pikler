Battle of the Bulge     the battle of the bulge ( 16 december 1944 â€“ 25 january 1945 ) was a major german attack near the end of world war ii , in belgium , france and luxembourg . the attack surprised allied forces . it became the worst battle in terms of casualties for the united states . it also used up huge amounts of germany 's war-making resources . the press made up `` battle of the bulge '' to describe the way the allied front line bulged inward on wartime news maps and became the best known name for the battle . the german attack was supported by several other operations . germany 's goal was to split the british and american allied line in half , capture antwerp , and then encircle and destroy four allied armies . they hoped this would force the allies to negotiate a peace treaty . then hitler could focus on the eastern front of the war . the attack was planned in secret . germany moved troops and equipment in the dark . the u.s. intelligence staff predicted a major german attack , but this still surprised them . the allied forces were overconfident and too focused on their own attack plans , and they also did n't have good aerial reconnaissance .
