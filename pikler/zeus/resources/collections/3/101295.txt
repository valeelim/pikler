File format     file formats are also known as file types . a computer stores data in a computer file in the shape of a file format . for example : images are stored in a different shape than music files . also , most types of data ( for example text , image or sound ) have many varieties of file formats , all with their own special strengths and weaknesses . there are , for example , more than five ways to store text as a file . two of the most known ways are : the plain `` .txt '' format and the simplest of the `` html '' formats . the difference is that a .txt file can only store a sequence of characters but an html file can also store links to other files and the formatting of the text , for example whether the text is bold , underlined or italic ( but usually html should say whether the text is very important , a link , or not very important ; whether important text should be bold , italic or red is then specified using a file in a special format called css ) . often a file in a file which can store more information is bigger than a file in a format which can only store simple basic data . but the file in the more functional ( complex , with can store more information ) format can be more difficult to use with more simple programs , and a faster computer can be needed to use it .
