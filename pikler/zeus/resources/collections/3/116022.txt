Buddhism in Pakistan     there are no significant buddhist communities left in pakistan . a few buddhists may still exist in pakistani kashmir and a significant community exists in jammu and kashmir to the east of the line of control . mostly ladakhi and ethnically related to tibetans ( plus a few indo-aryan dards ) , a rough dividing line between islamic culture and buddhist culture can be drawn through mulbekh and shergol in the indus valley ( to the east of kargil ) and well to the west of leh , the nun kun massif and rangdum buddhist monastery at the head of the suru river valley ( a tributary of the indus ) on the indian kashmiri side of the line of control . the region that is today known as pakistan once had a large buddhist population , with the majority of people in gandhara ( present day north western pakistan and eastern afghanistan ) being buddhist . gandhara was largely mahayana buddhist , and was also a stronghold of vajrayana buddhism . the swat valley , known in antiquity as uddiyana , was a kingdom tributary to gandhara . there are many archaeological sites from the buddhist era in swat .
