Hallstatt culture     the hallstatt era is named after the city hallstatt in austria , where the first artifacts were found . it lasted from about 1200 bc to about 275 bc . there were different periods , which today are mainly told apart by the kinds of brooches used . these brooches changed rather rapidly , and permit a good estimate . hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of france , in switzerland , in the south of germany , in austria , in slovenia and croatia , northwestern hungary , southwestern slovakia and southern moravia . in this time , the social structure developed into a hierarchy . this can be documented by various things that were added to graves , for example at magdalenenberg . in the bronze age , people used to live in big settlements . as iron became available , trade routes changed . a new upper class could establish itself . unlike before , these upper class people liked to live in big houses in the countryside , as a demonstration of their power . funerary cults also changed , from cremation burials , to burials with sarcophagi . the new upper class used their wealth for import goods , mostly from the mediterranean . people started settling there around the 2nd millennium b.c .
