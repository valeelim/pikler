Tautology (logic)    tautology ( logic ) in propositional logic , a tautology ( from the greek word ταυτολογία ) is a propositional formula that is always true . in other words , a tautology can not be wrong . for example , formulae in maths are tautological , because they always hold true for any values . the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein first applied the term to propositional logic in 1921. a statement in logic is considered correct if it is neither a tautology nor false . examples of a tautology : - `` i know that this is wikipedia because i know that this is wikipedia . '' - `` i am president of this club because i am the president of this club . '' - `` the first rule of the tautology club is the first rule of the tautology club . '' in other words , a tautology is : - a is true because a is true and if a is not true , then a is not true , so the tautology is still true .
