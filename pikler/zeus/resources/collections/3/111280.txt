Perito Moreno Glacier     the perito moreno glacier ( ) is a glacier in the southwest of santa cruz province , argentina . it is one of the most important tourist attractions in the argentine patagonia . the 250 kmÂ² ice formation , of 30 km in length , is one of 48 glaciers fed by the southern patagonian ice field in the andes system shared with chile . this icefield is the world 's third largest reserve of fresh water . the perito moreno glacier is one of only three patagonian glaciers that are not retreating . periodically the glacier advances over the l-shaped `` '' lago argentino '' '' ( `` argentine lake '' ) . when it reaches the opposite shore , it forms a natural dam which separates the two halves of the lake . with no escape route , the water-level on the `` brazo rico '' side of the lake can rise by up to 30 meters above the level of the main lake . the enormous pressure produced by this mass of waters finally breaks the ice barrier holding it back , in a spectacular rupture event . this dam/rupture cycle is not regular and it naturally recurs at any frequency between once a year to less than once a decade .
