Bayonet     a bayonet ( from french `` ba√Øonnette '' ) is a knife- or dagger-shaped weapon . it is designed to be attached to a rifle barrel or similar weapon . this will turn the gun into a spear . it is a close-combat or last-resort weapon . 18th and 19th century military tactics included the use of a bayonet fixed on the infantryman 's musket . these were used with massed troop formations . one of the more notable of these was the `` bayonet charge '' . this was an attack by a formation of infantrymen with fixed bayonets , usually over short distances . it was to overrun enemy strong points , capture artillery batteries , or break up enemy troop formations . with the use of the bayonet , the pike was no longer used because infantry could now defend themselves from cavalry without sacrificing firepower per man . the russian army used the bayonet frequently during the napoleonic wars . a russian saying coined by russian general alexander suvorov was `` the bullet is foolish , the bayonet wise '' . given russia 's often poorly trained armies and inaccurate smoothbore muskets , russian officers preferred to use the bayonet charge instead of musket volley fire where possible .
