Violin Concerto (Berg)    violin concerto ( berg ) alban berg 's violin concerto was written in 1935. it is one of the most famous concertos for the violin written in the 20th century . it is also probably berg 's best known and most often performed piece . berg was asked to write a violin concerto for the violinist louis krasner . at the time he was working hard on his opera `` lulu '' , which took him several years to write . he stopped working on the opera for four months in the summer of 1935 so that he could write the violin concerto . he had probably already started the concerto when he heard the sad news of the death of a girl called manon gropius , the daughter of alma mahler ( who had once been gustav mahler 's wife ) and walter gropius . berg decided to dedicate the concerto to manon . he wrote at the top of the work : `` to the memory of an angel . '' when berg died on 24 december 1935 he had not finished `` lulu '' . it is possible he might have finished it if he had not spent time writing the violin concerto . the work was first performed after the composer 's death , with krasner playing the solo part , on 19 april 1936 in barcelona .
