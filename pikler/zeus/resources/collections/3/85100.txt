Recording studio     a recording studio is a place prepared for the recording of music , or other sound media . some studios are independent , but many are part of a larger business , like a record label . independent studios may only record one band or set of performers , but may also lease time to outsiders . some studios charge an hourly rate , while others charge by the project . recording studios are usually divided into three areas : a `` live area '' ( with natural ) for recording groups , a `` dead area '' ( with to prevent reverb and echoes ) for vocals and soloists , and a control booth , to house the recording equipment . studios are usually soundproofed , to keep outside noises from getting into recordings . and other objects are used inside studios , to isolate sound sources . room shapes are also used , to prevent `` standing waves '' and sound interference . early recording studios were not much different from radio studios , and the techniques used were , but this changed over the years . recordings could present sounds in ways radio could not carry , and radio did not play only recordings , so the shift was natural . when recording was developed in the 1950s , radio stations did not need multitrack equipment , for example . ( today some radio stations have such equipment , but use it to pre-record material . )
