Carpe diem     carpe diem is a famous phrase from one of the poems of horace . it means `` seize the day '' in latin . especially during the baroque era , the phrase was important . in the 17th century there was the thirty years ' war , which lasted roughly from 1618 to 1648. for the people of the time , death was present almost everywhere . to compensate for that there were the concepts of `` carpe diem '' ( there is little time left , use it as best you can ) , `` vanitas '' ( vanity ; things are not what they seem ) , and memento mori ( remember you will die ) . the poem is originally from `` odes '' 1.11. it is given in latin and english below . a better translation of the phrase would probably be `` pluck the day '' ( as a fruit might be plucked from a tree ) .
