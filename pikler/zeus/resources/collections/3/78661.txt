Neotropic     in context of biogeography , neotropic or neotropical means one of the world 's eight terrestrial ecozones . this ecozone includes south and central america , the mexican lowlands , the caribbean islands , and southern florida , because these regions share a large number of plant and animal groups . it is sometimes used as a synonym for the tropical area of south america , although the ecozone also includes temperate southern south america . its fauna and flora are distinct from the nearctic ( which includes most of north america ) because of the long separation of the two continents . the formation of the isthmus of panama joined the two continents 2 to 3 million years ago . the neotropic includes more tropical rainforest than any other ecozone . they extend from southern mexico through central america and northern south america to southern brazil and include the amazon rainforest . these rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of biodiversity on earth . extensive deforestation in the late 20th century has reduced this diversity to a degree .
