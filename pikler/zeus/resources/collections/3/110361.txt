Ammonite     ammonites were marine cephalopod molluscs of the subclass ammonoidea . their widely-known fossils show a ribbed spiral-form shell , in the end compartment of which lived the tentacled animal . these creatures lived in the seas from at least 400 to 65 million years ago . they became extinct at the k/t extinction event . their nearest living relatives are the octopus , squid , cuttlefish and `` nautilus '' . nine orders are recognised in the ammonoidea : five in the palaeozoic and four in the mesozoic . ammonites first appeared in the early devonian period . they evolved from a small , straight shelled bactridian , which was an early nautiloid . they quickly evolved into a variety of shapes and sizes , including some shaped like hairpins . during their evolution the ammonites faced no fewer than four catastrophic events that would eventually lead to their extinction . the first event occurred in the upper devonian , and the second at the end of the permian ( 250 million years ago ) , when only two lines survived the p/tr extinction event . the surviving species radiated and flourished throughout the triassic perod . at the end of this period ( 206 million years ago ) they faced near extinction again , when only one genus survived . this event marked the end of the triassic and the beginning of the jurassic , during which time the number of ammonite species grew once more . the final catastrophe occurred at the end of the cretaceous period when all species were annihilated and the ammonites became extinct .
