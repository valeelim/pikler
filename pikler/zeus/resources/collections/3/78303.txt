Stroke     a stroke is an event which damages part of the brain . this can happen if an artery that feeds blood to the brain gets clogged , or if it tears and leaks . strokes are often called a brain attack because of the similarities it has to a heart attack . a heart attack is when there is a lack of blood flow to the heart and a stroke is when there is a lack of blood flow to the brain . there are two types of strokes . one is when there is a blood clot blocking the artery . an artery is a type of tube that takes blood to different parts of your body . the other type of stroke is when a blood vessel bursts and there is blood moving around freely in the brain . a blood vessel is another type of tube that carries blood to your body . a stroke , or cerebrovascular accident ( cva ) , is the rapid loss of brain function ( s ) due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain . this can happen because of ischemia ( lack of blood flow ) caused by blockage ( thrombosis , arterial embolism ) , or a haemorrhage ( leakage of blood ) .
