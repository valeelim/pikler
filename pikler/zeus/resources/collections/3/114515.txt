'' came during a lunch in 1994 attended by john lasseter , pete docter , andrew stanton and joe ranft . one of the ideas that came out of the brainstorming session was a movie about monsters . `` when we were making `` toy story '' , pete docter claimed , `` everybody came up to me and said that they totally believed that their toys came to life when they left the room . when disney asked us to make more films , i wanted to tap into a child-like notion that was similar to `` toy story '' . i knew monsters were coming out of my closet when i was a kid . so i decided monsters would be appropriate '' . docter 's original idea revolved around a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters ( which he drew in a book as a boy ) coming back to bother him as an adult . each monster represented a fear he had , and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear .
