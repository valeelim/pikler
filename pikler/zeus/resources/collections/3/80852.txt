Differential coefficient     in mathematics , differential coefficient is a term out of use now . the former `` differential coefficient '' of a function `` f '' ( `` x '' ) is now called its derivative `` df '' ( `` x '' ) / '' dx '' . it is the ( not necessarily constant ) multiplicative factor or `` coefficient '' of the differential `` dx '' in the differential `` df '' ( `` x '' ) . the differential coefficient of `` f '' is a constant function only if `` f '' is a linear function . early editions of silvanus p. thompson 's `` calculus made easy '' use the older term . in his 1998 update of this text , martin gardner puts `` derivative '' instead of `` differential coefficient '' . he speaks of it only in context with thompson 's criticism of the term .
