Weathering     weathering is the breaking down of rocks , soil and their minerals through direct contact with the earth 's atmosphere , waters , or living things . weathering occurs `` in situ '' ( in place , with no movement ) . it is a type of erosion . erosion is where rocks and minerals are moved downhill ( usually towards the sea ) by water , ice and wind . dynamic movement is always taking place on earth . one type of change raises the land surface upwards to form ( at the highest ) huge mountain ranges . this orogeny is formed as a result of plate tectonics , such as the collision of continental plates . at the same time , all land surfaces are being ground down gradually all the time . material from the land ends up in the seas or lakes , and forms the sediment which finally ends up as sedimentary rock . rocks and minerals break up under the influence of water , ice , wind and gravity , and other causes . the two main types of weathering are `` physical '' and `` chemical '' . sometimes there are also aspects of biology .
