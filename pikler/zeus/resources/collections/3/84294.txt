Religious debates over the Harry Potter series     religious debates over the `` harry potter '' series of books by j. k. rowling are usually because people say the books have occult or satanic parts . these sayings come from some protestant , catholic , and orthodox christians . it also comes from muslims who argue against the series . a great number of people have replied to these claims . people who support the series say that the magic in `` harry potter '' is not really like occultism . they say it is more like fairy tales like `` cinderella '' and `` snow white '' . they also suggest that it is more like the works of c. s. lewis and j. r. r. tolkien . both writers are known for writing fantasy novels with christian values . some argue that the `` harry potter '' novels try hard not to discuss religion at all . in the united states , people tried to get the books banned in schools . their argument was that witchcraft is a registered religion , so letting the books in schools went against the separation of church and state . this then went to court to decide whether it was against the freedom of religion .
