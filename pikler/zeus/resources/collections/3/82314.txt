Greater Antilles     the islands of the caribbean sea , collectively known as the west indies are sorted by size and location into the bahamas ( or lucayan archipelago ) , the lesser antilles and the greater antilles . the greater antilles are cuba , jamaica , hispaniola ( composed of haiti on the west side and the dominican republic on the east side ) and puerto rico . the smaller islands in the vicinity of these four major islands are sometimes also treated as part of the group . this includes the smaller islands thst surrounding the main islands , but are still part of the main island country ( e.g . the republic of cuba consists of the island of cuba and several smaller islands around it ) . the cayman islands are also often included in the greater antilles because of their geographical proximity . the greater antilles are made up of continental rock , distinct from the lesser antilles , which are mostly young volcanic or coral islands .
