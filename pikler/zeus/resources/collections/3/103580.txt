Quickdraw     a quickdraw is used in rock climbing for lead climbing . one end is hooked into an anchor in the wall . afterwards the rope is hooked into the other end . usually quickdraws are used every few meters . quickdraws are made of two carabiners connected by a sling . quickdraws can hold up to 22 kn . the quickdraw has one straight gate carabineer and one bent gate carabineer . the bent gate carabineer should always be the one clipped to the rope . for leading and top roping at an indoor climbing wall usually a quickdraw is already attached to each of the protection points on the route . the lower carabineer , ( the one with the bent gate ) should be clipped so the gate is pointing away from the rope and pointing away from the climbing wall or rock face . doing this will help prevent the quickdraw from twisting the gate into the wall . the rope should run freely through the spine of each carabineer , not along the gate . the spine is the strongest part of the carabineer .
