Jura (canton)    jura ( canton ) the canton of jura is one of the cantons of switzerland . it is the newest of the 26 swiss cantons ( created in 1979 ) and is in the northwestern part of switzerland . the capital is delémont . it shares borders with the canton of basel-landschaft , the canton of bern , and the french département of jura . canton jura is in northwest switzerland . it includes parts of the jura mountains in the south and the jura plateau in the north . the jura plateau is hilly and almost entirely limestone . to the north and the west of jura is france . the canton of solothurn and basel-landschaft are east of jura , while the canton of bern is south of jura . the river doubs and the river birs drain the lands . the king of burgundy donated much of the land that today makes up canton jura to the bishop of basel in 999. the area was a sovereign state within the holy roman empire for more than 800 years . after the treaty of westphalia in 1648 the jura had close ties with the swiss confederation . in the congress of vienna the jura was given to the canton bern . this act caused dissension . the jura was french-speaking and roman catholic , whereas the canton of bern was mostly german-speaking and protestant . the people of the jura region called for independence . after a long struggle , a constitution was accepted in 1977. in 1978 the split was made official when the swiss people voted in favour of it , and in 1979 the jura joined the swiss confederation as a full member . however , the southern part of the jura region , which is also predominantly french-speaking but has a protestant majority , opted not to join the newly-formed canton , and instead remained part of bern . this area is now known as bernese jura . the word jura , therefore , may refer either to canton jura , or to the combined territory of canton jura and bernese jura .
