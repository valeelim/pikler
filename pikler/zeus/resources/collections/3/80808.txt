Composite material     composite materials are made from two or more basic material mixed together . the materials can be natural or not , and keep their separate properties when mixed together . however , the composite material as a whole may behave differently from either of its parts . for example , reinforced concrete ( made of concrete and steel ) has resistance to pressure and to bending forces . bullet-proof glass ( made of glass and plastic ) is more resistant to impact than either glass or plastic on their own . concrete itself is a composite material , one of the oldest man-made composites , used more than any other man-made material in the world . wood is a natural composite of cellulose fibres in a matrix of lignin . the earliest man-made composite materials were straw and mud combined to form bricks for building construction . this ancient brick-making process was documented by egyptian tomb paintings . fibre-reinforced polymers are in wide use today , as is glass-reinforced plastic . the most primitive composite materials were straw and mud in the form of bricks for building construction . the biblical book of exodus tells of the israelites that were oppressed by pharaoh and forced to make `` bricks without straw '' . today we use shower stalls and bath tubs made of fiberglass , a type of composite .
