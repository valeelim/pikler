Ajax (programming)    ajax ( programming ) ajax stands for asynchronous javascript and xml . it is a technique used to make webpages faster to use . if they are programmed with ajax , they seem to react faster . they only send small bits of information to the web server . that way the whole web page does not need to reload , only small parts of it . good things . - there is a clear separation between what the page shows ( the content ) , how it looks ( the style ) , and what it does ( the function ) . programmers that change what the page does do not need to concern themselves with how the page looks . - pages done with ajax only load small bits from the server . most of the time , they execute code on the client . this makes the program load first so it can respond faster . - ajax can be used to read xml or json among other file formats . there are also some problems with ajax . these are among other things : - it uses javascript . some people have disabled javascript . - because it does not reload the full page , it breaks the `` history '' function of the web browser . the `` back button '' does not work any more .
