Palaeolithic     the palaeolithic , ( or paleolithic ) , refers to the prehistoric period when stone tools were made by humans . they are found in the great rift valley of africa from about 3.3 million years ago . they were probably made by australopithecines . they are found in europe somewhat later , from about 1 mya ( 0.7mya for britain ) . the palaeolithic is by far the longest period of humanity 's time , about 99 % of human history . the geological period which corresponds to the palaeolithic is the pleistocene . stone tools were not only made by our own species , `` homo sapiens '' . they were made by all previous members of the genus , starting with relatively crude tools made by `` homo habilis '' and `` homo erectus '' . in europe , the large-brained neanderthal man ( `` homo neanderthalensis '' ) made tools of high quality , and was in turn outshone by the many tools made by our own species . these tools are the first cultural products which have survived . the palaeolithic dates from about 2.6 million years ago and ended around 15,000 with the mesolithic in western europe , and with the epipaleolithic in warmer climates such as africa . the palaeolithic age began when hominids ( early humans ) started to use stones as tools for bashing , cutting and scraping . the age ended when humans began to make small , fine tools ( mesolithic ) and finally when plant crops and have other types of agriculture ( neolithic ) . in some areas , such as western europe , the way that people lived was affected by the ice age . the move towards agriculture started in the middle east .
