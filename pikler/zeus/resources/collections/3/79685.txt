'' on august 14 , 2002. halimede follows a very inclined and very eccentric orbit seen on the image in relation to other non-spherical moons of neptune . halimede is about 62 kilometres in diameter ( assuming an albedo of 0.04 ) and appears neutral ( grey ) in the visible light . given the very similar colour of the moon to that of nereid together with a high probability ( 41 % ) of their collision in the lifespan of the solar system , it has been suggested that the moon could be a piece of nereid . halimede , or neptune ix , like many of the farther moons of neptune , is named after one of the nereids , the fifty daughters of nereus and doris . before the announcement of its name on february 3 , 2007 ( iauc 8802 ) , halimede was known by the designation s/2002 n 1. other websites . - matthew holman 's neptune 's page - david jewitt 's pages - scott sheppard 's pages
