Čerenkov radiation    čerenkov radiation the cherenkov effect is an effect in physics discovered by pavel alekseyevich čerenkov . according to special relativity , a particle can not move faster than the speed of light in a vacuum . however , when light travels in a transparent medium ( such as water or glass ) , it moves more slowly than it would in a vacuum . this means that particles can actually move faster than the speed of light in certain mediums . when a particle with an electric charge moves faster than light in a medium which can be polarized , it causes the medium to send out photons ( light particles ) and thereby loses energy . the photons that are sent out can be measured , as they are simple light . because nothing can move faster than light in a vacuum , there is no cherenkov light in a vacuum . however , if we say that light in water moves only with 75 % of its speed in vacuum , particles with very high energy are now able to move faster than light ( through water ) and create cherenkov light . the reason cherenkov light often appears blue is because its effect is proportional to the frequency , in that the higher the frequency , the higher the effect of the radiation . because higher frequency light equates to shorter wavelengths , and blue light has one of the shortest wavelengths of visible light , cherenkov light is usually blue .
