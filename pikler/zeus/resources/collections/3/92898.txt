Mathematical proof     a mathematical proof is a way to show that a math theorem is true . one must show that the theory is true in all cases . there are different ways of proving a mathematical theorem . one type of proof is called proof by induction . this is usually used to prove a theorem that is true for all numbers . there are 4 steps in a proof by induction . 1. state that the proof will be by induction , and state which variable will be used in the induction step . 2. prove that the statement is true for some beginning case . 3. assume that for some value `` n '' = `` n '' the statement is true and has all of the properties listed in the statement . this is called the induction step . 4. show that the statement is true for the next value , `` n '' +1 . once that is shown , then it means that for any value of `` n '' that is picked , the next one is true . since it 's true for some beginning case ( usually `` n '' =1 ) , then it 's true for the next one ( `` n '' =2 ) . and since it 's true for 2 , it must be true for 3. and since it 's true for 3 , it must be true for 4 , etc . induction shows that it is always true , precisely because it 's true for whatever comes after any given number .
