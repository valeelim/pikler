Himalia (moon)    himalia ( moon ) himalia is the biggest non-spherical moon of jupiter . it was found by charles dillon perrine at the lick observatory on december 3 1904. it is named after the nymph himalia who bore three sons of zeus ( the greek equivalent of jupiter ) . himalia did not get its present name until 1975 ; before then , it was simply known as or jupiter satellite vi , although calls for a full name appeared shortly after its and elara 's discovery ; a.c.d . crommelin wrote in 1905 , unfortunately the numeration of jupiter 's satellites is now in precisely the same confusion as that of saturn 's system was before the numbers were abandoned and names substituted . a similar course would seem to be advisable here ; the designation v for the inner satellite was tolerated for a time , as it was considered to be in a class by itself ; but it has now got companions , so that this subterfuge disappears . the substitution of names for numerals is certainly more poetic . the moon was sometimes called hestia , after the greek goddess , from 1955 to 1975 .
