Decomposer     a decomposer is an organism that breaks down long chain polymers from dead organisms into smaller molecules . decomposers are bacteria and fungi . what they do is use the parts and energy to build up their own materials , which are also organic . decomposers are heterotrophs . this means they use organic substrates to get their energy , carbon and nutrients for growth and development . decomposers break down cells of other organisms using biochemical reactions without need for internal digestion . this is different from detritivores , which actually digest dead organic matter . decomposition also involves abiotic decomposition . this is breakdown by chemical processes , such as hydrolysis , or physical processes , such as heat . this turns organic material into inorganic material , and so returns nutrients to the environment . other pages . - mushrooms - microbes - ecosystems - producers - consumers
