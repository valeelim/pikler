Warthog     warthog ( `` phacochoerus africanus '' ) are remarkable animals . they are found in most of africa south of the sahara and are widely distributed in east africa . they are the only pigs able to live in areas without water for several months of the year . by tolerating a higher-than-normal body temperature , the warthog is perhaps able to conserve moisture inside its body that might otherwise be used for cooling . ( camels and desert gazelles have developed a similar mechanism for survival in hot , arid environments . ) warthogs are found in moist and arid savannas . they avoid rainforest , deserts and high mountains .
