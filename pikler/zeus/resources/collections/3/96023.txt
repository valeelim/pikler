Numismatics     numismatics is the study and collecting of coins and the history behind the coins . a numismatist is either a collector of coins or a scholar who studies the history of coins . the term comes from a word meaning `` of coins . '' the original word is french ( numismatique ) , which itself is from a latin origin ( numismatis ) . coin collectors may have existed in ancient times . caesar augustus may have been an example . the first known book about coin collecting was in 1514 , `` de asse et partibus '' , by guillaume bud√© . however , only royalty really enjoyed coin collecting until the 19th century . that 's when professional organizations started to sprout , like the american numismatic society in 1858. modern numismatics is a sub-field that focuses on when coins started being stamped by machines ( around 17th century on ) . because of its focus , modern numismatics is more popular with collectors than with historians . other subfields/variants include exonumia ( focus on coin-like objects ) , notaphily ( focus on paper money instead of coins ) , and scripophily ( focus on stocks and bonds instead of coins ) .
