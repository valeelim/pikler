Sakoku     sakoku ( japanese : 鎖国 , literally `` country in chains '' or `` lock up of country '' ) was the foreign policy of japan under which no foreigner or japanese could enter or leave the country on penalty of death . the policy was enacted by the tokugawa shogunate under tokugawa iemitsu through a number of edicts and policies from 1633-1639 and remained in effect until 1853 with the arrival of commodore matthew perry and the opening of japan . it was still illegal to leave japan until the meiji restoration ( 1868 ) . but japan was not completely isolated under the `` sakoku '' policy . rather , it was a system in which strict regulations were applied to commerce and foreign relations by the shogunate . on july 8 , 1853 , commodore matthew perry of the u.s. navy with four warships demanded that japan open to trade with the west . the following year 1854 , perry returned with seven ships and forced the shogun to sign the `` treaty of peace and amity '' , establishing formal diplomatic relations between japan and the united states .
