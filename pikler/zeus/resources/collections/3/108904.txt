Peterhof     peterhof ( or petergof ) , meaning `` peter 's court '' is a town in saint petersburg on the southern shore of the gulf of finland . it has a population of about 65,000. it hosts one of two campuses of saint petersburg state university . a series of palaces and gardens , laid out on the orders of peter the great , and sometimes called the `` russian versailles '' , is also there . the palace-ensemble along with the city center is a unesco world heritage site . in the time of peter the great , the sea floor just north of the petergof site and to the east toward st. petersburg was too shallow for commercial ships or warships . but to the west of petergof , the sea floor dropped off to be deep enough for sea vessels . accordingly , when peter the great decided to build st. petersburg at the eastern end of the gulf of finland , he built the commercial harbor for st. petersburg and the kronstadt fort across the 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) of shallow sea to supply and defend his navy .
