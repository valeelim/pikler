Western Roman Empire     the western roman empire was the western half of the roman empire , from its division by diocletian in 286 ; the other half of the roman empire became known as the eastern roman empire , today widely known as the byzantine empire . the whole roman empire had been in difficulties since 190 ad when large tribes of people like the goths , began moving into areas under roman control . the leadership of rome was weak ; there was a lot of instability as various power groups within the roman armies kept trying to install their own emperors , and murdering emperors who belonged to other groups . this meant the invasions by the germanic tribes were not successfully stopped . the emperor diocletian tried to bring stability back into government by dividing the empire into sections . these became the western empire which included spain , france , england , italy and parts of germany , and the eastern empire which included greece , turkey , the middle east and northern egypt . rome ceased to be the capital from the time of the division . in 286 , the capital of the western roman empire became mediolanum ( modern milan ) . in 402 , the capital was again moved , this time to ravenna .
