Obsidian     obsidian is a natural volcanic glass found as a kind of igneous rock . it is produced when lava high in silica ( sio ) cools rapidly , and solidifies without time for crystal growth . because there is no crystal structure , obsidian blade edges can reach almost molecular thinness , leading to its ancient use as arrowheads , and its modern use as surgical scalpel blades . obsidian is mineral-like , but not crystalline . it is dark in color like basalt . it consists mainly of sio ( silicon dioxide ) , usually 70 % or more . obsidian does not last forever . it is metastable : it changes very slowly . over time , the glass becomes fine-grained crystals . so , no obsidian is older than cretaceous age . it breaks down faster when water is present . obsidian has little water , but takes it in if it sits in groundwater . usually dark , the color varies on the presence of different materials . iron and magnesium typically give the obsidian a dark green to brown to black color . a few samples are nearly colorless . in some stones , small crystals produce a snowflake pattern ( `` snowflake obsidian '' ) . it may contain patterns of gas which produce effects such as a golden sheen ( `` sheen obsidian '' ) or a rainbow sheen ( `` rainbow obsidian '' ) .
