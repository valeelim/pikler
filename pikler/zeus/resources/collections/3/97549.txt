Nuclear power plant     a nuclear power plant is a type of power station that generates electricity using heat from nuclear reactions . these reactions take place within a reactor . the plant also has machines which remove heat from the reactor to operate a steam turbine and generator to make electricity . electricity made by nuclear power plants is called nuclear power . nuclear power plants are usually near water to remove the heat the reactor makes . some nuclear power plants use cooling towers to do this . nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel . when the reactor is on , uranium atoms inside the reactor split into two smaller atoms . when uranium atoms split , they give off a large amount of heat . this splitting of atoms is called fission . the most popular atoms to fission are uranium and plutonium . those atoms are slightly radioactive . the atoms produced when fuel atoms break apart are strongly radioactive . today , fission only happens in nuclear reactors . in nuclear reactors , fission only happens when the reactors parts are arranged properly . nuclear power plants turn their reactors off when replacing old nuclear fuel with new fuel .
