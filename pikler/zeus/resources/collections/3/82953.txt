Compass (drafting)    compass ( drafting ) a compass ( or pair of compasses ) is a drawing tool that can be used to draw circles or arcs , parts of circles . they can also be used to measure distances , in particular on maps . compasses can be used for mathematics , drafting , navigation , and more . compasses are usually made of metal , and have two parts called `` legs '' meeting at a hinge . the legs can be moved apart or together to change the size of the circle . one part has a spike , a sharp , pointy part at its end , and the other part has a pencil or a pen . there are two types of compasses : the mechanical compass and normal compass . the mechanical compass is a compass that has a mechanical pencil , and the normal compass is a compass that has a normal pen or pencil on it . to make the compass work , you need to change how far the pencil sticks out . a divider is a compass that has two parts with a spike , and is used to show measurements of distances and lengths . it is called a divider because it is used to divide ( make smaller things from a bigger thing ) a distance in two , using geometry .
