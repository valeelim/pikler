Ananke group     the ananke group is a group of retrograde non-spherical moons of jupiter that follow similar orbits to ananke and are thought to have a common origin . their semi-major axes ( distances from jupiter ) range between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000 km , their inclinations between 145.7° and 154.8° , and their orbital eccentricities between 0.02 and 0.28. the core members include ( from biggest to smallest ) : - ananke - praxidike - iocaste - harpalyke - thyone - euanthe - euporie the international astronomical union ( iau ) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons , including this group 's members . the ananke group is believed to have been formed when an asteroid was captured by jupiter and broken apart by a collision . based on the sizes of the moons , the original asteroid may have been about 28 km in diameter . since this value is near the approximate diameter of ananke itself , it is likely the parent body was not heavily disrupted . three of the moons of the family ( harpalyke , praxidike and iocaste ) display similar grey colours while ananke itself is on the boundary between grey and light red .
