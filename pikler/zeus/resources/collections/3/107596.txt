Little Ice Age     the little ice age ( lia ) was a period of cooling after a warmer era ( time ) that is known as the medieval warm period . climatologists ( people who study climate ) and historians find it difficult to agree on either the start or end dates of this period . some say the little ice age started about the 16th century and continued to the mid 19th century . it is generally agreed that there were three minima , one beginning about 1650 , one about 1770 , the last one about 1850. each time was separated by slight warming intervals . at first , it was believed that the lia was all over the world . now it is not clear if this is true . during the period 1645–1715 , in the middle of the little ice age , there was a period of low solar activity known as the maunder minimum . the physical link between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures has not been established , but the coincidence of the maunder minimum with the deepest trough of the little ice age is suggestive of such a connection . the spörer minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period near the beginning of the little ice age . other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon-14 and beryllium-10 .
