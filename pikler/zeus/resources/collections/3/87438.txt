Jury     a jury is a group of people who decide the answer to a question in a court room . usually , this question is whether a person is guilty or innocent of committing a crime . a jury may also be responsible for deciding a penalty for the person if he is found guilty . normally , all members of the jury have to agree on the decision . sometimes , the jury can still make a decision even if a few members do n't agree with it . however , if the jury is quite clearly divided , the result is known as a `` hung jury '' and the case is not decided . a member of a jury is called a juror . a juror is supposed to be impartial . this means that he or she is to be fair and listen to both sides of the story without deciding what side they will take ahead of time . in the united states there are primarily two types of juries which are the finder of facts in a trial : - a petit jury also called a trial jury is one made up of from 6 to 12 jurors . - a grand jury is called by a prosecutor to decide if there is probable cause to believe someone has committed a crime . if so , the grand jury returns an indictment against the defendant .
