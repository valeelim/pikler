243 Ida     243 ida is a main belt asteroid with pictures taken by the `` galileo '' spacecraft on august 28 , 1993. it was the first binary asteroid to be found and is a member of the koronis family of asteroids . ida was found by johann palisa on september 29 , 1884 in vienna . it is named after ida , a cretan nymph in greek mythology who lived on a mountain that has her name ( see mount ida , crete ) . ida has a small moon , dactyl , which was found on february 17 , 1994 by `` galileo '' mission member ann harch , while examining the delayed image downloads . the moon was given the designation s/1993 ( 243 ) 1 and later named ( 243 ) ida i dactyl . the pictures where it was first seen were taken on 28 august 1993 , hence the designation . the moon was reported on 12 march 1994. dactyl is only 1.4 km in diameter . some researchers believe that dactyl formed from debris blown off from ida because of cratering , while others suggest that ida and dactyl formed as a pair a billion or more years ago when ida 's parent body was disrupted . both of these theories present difficulties that are unresolved at this time . since dactyl was found , other sightings have suggested that asteroid moons are common .
