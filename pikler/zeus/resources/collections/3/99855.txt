Pinniped     pinnipeds are the seals and their relatives , a group of semi-aquatic marine mammals . the pinnipedia is in the order carnivora . there are three seal families : odobenidae ( walruses ) , otariidae ( eared seals , including sea lions and fur seals ) , and phocidae ( true seals ) . seals are sleek-bodied and barrel-shaped . their bodies are well adapted to the aquatic habitat where they spend most of their lives . pinnipeds have flippers for hands , big bulky bodies , doggish faces , and big eyes . unlike cetaceans , pinnipeds have their noses on their face , and each nostril of the nose closes when the pinniped goes under water . like cetaceans , pinnipeds have a thick layer of blubber ( fat ) just under their skin : this blubber keeps them warm in cold waters and keeps them fed during times when food is not easily found . when they can not find food , they live off the fat in the blubber . pinnipeds are carnivorous . this means they eat only meat ( such as fish or squid ) and not plants . however , almost all pinnipeds can be eaten by sharks or orca whales .
