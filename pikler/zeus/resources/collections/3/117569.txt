Causality     causality is a way to describe how different events relate to one another . suppose there are two events `` a '' and `` b '' . if `` b '' happens because `` a '' happened , then people say that a `` is the cause '' of b , or that b `` is the effect of '' a. what looks very simple , is in fact a difficult problem . many people have tried to solve it , they have come up with different solutions aristotle was an greek philosopher . he also looked at the problem of causality . in his books `` posterior analytics '' and `` metaphysics '' he wrote : - `` all causes are beginnings ... '' - `` ... we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause ... '' - `` ... to know a thing 's nature is to know the reason why it is ... '' this can be used to explain causality . aristotle found different kinds of causes : - the material cause is that `` raw material '' from which a thing is made . this is sometimes called the `` part-whole causation '' . example : the bronze of a statue . - the formal cause tells us what , by using the example of an artist , a thing is planned to be . this is sometimes called `` the whole-part causation '' . example the shape of a statue .
