Nile Delta     the nile delta ( ) is the delta formed in northern egypt ( lower egypt ) where the nile river spreads out and drains into the mediterranean sea . it is one of the world 's largest river deltas—from alexandria in the west to port said in the east , it covers some 240 km of mediterranean coastline—and is a rich agricultural region . from north to south the delta is approximately 160 km in length . the delta begins slightly down-river from cairo . dams farther upstream on the nile have stopped further addition of the silt that built the delta in past centuries . because of this , the delta is shrinking . the nile is considered to be an `` arcuate '' delta ( arc-shaped ) , and resembles a triangle or lotus flower when seen from above . the nile delta has a mediterranean climate , characterized by little rainfall . only 100 to 200 mm of rain falls on the delta area during an average year , and most of this falls in the winter months . the delta experiences its hottest temperatures in july and august , averaging 30 °c , with a maximum of around 48 °c . winter temperatures are normally in the range of 5° to 10 °c . the nile delta region becomes quite humid during the summer months . the nile delta is currently eroding .
