Nereid (moon)    nereid ( moon ) nereid or neptune ii , is a moon of neptune . nereid was found on 1 may 1949 by gerard p. kuiper , who suggested the name in the report of his discovery . it is named after the nereids , sea-nymphs of greek mythology . it was the farthest of neptune 's known moons for a long time ( halimede through neso have since taken that honour ) , and is the third biggest , with a diameter of 340 km . its orbit averages 5,513,400 km in radius , but is very eccentric and varies from 1,353,600 to 9,623,700 kilometres . for a long time this was the most highly eccentric orbit of any known moon in the solar system , but it has found that bestla , a recently discovered moon of saturn has a more eccentric orbit . the unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured asteroid or kuiper belt object , or possibly that it was perturbed during the capture of neptune 's largest moon triton . very little else is known of nereid . nereid was too far to be properly imaged by the `` voyager 2 '' probe when it visited the neptune system in 1989. photos sent back show only its very non-spherical shape , and no surface features could be seen at the resolution available .
