Purchasing Power Parity     there are two ways to measure gdp ( total income of a country ) of different countries and compare them . one way , called gdp at exchange rate , is when the currencies of all countries are converted into usd ( united states dollar ) . the second way is gdp ( ppp ) or gdp at purchasing power parity ( ppp ) . purchasing power parity ( ppp ) is measured by finding the values ( in usd ) of a basket of consumer goods that are present in each country ( such as orange juice , pencils , etc. ) . if that basket costs $ 100 in the us and $ 200 in the united kingdom , then the purchasing power parity exchange rate is 1:2. for example , suppose that japan has a higher gdp per capita ( $ 18 ) than the us ( $ 16 ) . that means that japanese on average make $ 2 more than normal americans . however , they are not necessarily richer . suppose that one gallon of orange juice costs $ 6 in japan and only $ 2 in the us ; then $ 6 in japan exchanges to only $ 2 worth of us goods , since the japanese can only buy 3 gallons while the americans can buy 8 gallons . we have decided to use 1 gallon of orange juice as a reference basket of goods . therefore we can create a ppp index for japan in terms of the us as 1/3 . therefore , in terms of orange juice , the americans are richer , and in this example the us has a gdp ( ppp ) of $ 16 , unchanged since it is the reference currency . japan , however , has gdp ( ppp ) of only $ 6 since the $ 18 in japan can only buy 3 gallons of orange juice , which represents only $ 6 of us goods .
