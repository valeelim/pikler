Geographic coordinate system     a geographical coordinate system is a coordinate system . this means that every place can be specified by a set of three numbers , called coordinates . a full circle can be divided into 360 degrees ( or 360° ) ; this was first done by the babylonians ; ancient greeks , like ptolemy later extended the theory . today , degrees are divided further . there are minutes , and seconds ; 1 minute ( or 1 ' ) in this context is 1/60 of a degree ; 1 second ( or 1 '' ) is 1/60 of a minute . the first concept needed is called `` latitude '' ( lat , or the greek symbol `` phi '' , formula_1 ) . for it , the earth is cut up into 180 circles , from the equator . the poles are at 90° , the north pole is at 90° n ( orth ) , the south pole is at 90° s ( outh ) . places with the same latitude are on a circle , around the earth . the other concept is called `` longitude '' ( long , or the greek symbol `` lambda '' , formula_2 ) , sometimes referred to as `` meridian '' . the 0° longitude line ( or zero meridian ) goes through the royal observatory in greenwich . greenwich is a part of london . then lines are drawn in a similar way ; the opposite ( or `` antipodal '' ) meridian of greenwich is considered both 180°w ( est ) , and 180°e ( ast ) .
