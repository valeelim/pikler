First officer     in commercial aviation , the first officer is the second pilot ( sometimes referred to as the `` co-pilot '' ) of an aircraft . the first officer is second-in-command of the aircraft , to the captain who is the legal commander . in the event of incapacitation of the captain , the first officer will assume command of the aircraft . control of the aircraft is normally shared equally between the first officer and the captain , with one pilot normally designated the `` pilot flying '' ( pf ) and the other the `` pilot not flying '' ( pnf ) for each flight . even when the first officer is the flying pilot , however , the captain remains ultimately responsible for the aircraft , its passengers , and the crew . in typical day-to-day operations , the essential job tasks remain fairly equal . the pilot is seated in the left seat of the cockpit , and the co-pilot is positioned in the right seat . generally one of the two will fly the airplane , while the other navigates and is in charge of radio communication .
