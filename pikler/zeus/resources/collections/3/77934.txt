Connotation     connotation is a meaning that is suggested or implied , as opposed to a denotation , or literal definition . today the word has different meanings , but it is always used for the contrast of a word or phrase with its primary , literal meaning ( known as a denotation ) . that can be an implied value judgement or feelings . - a stubborn person may be described as being either `` strong-willed '' or `` pig-headed '' . although these have the same literal meaning ( i.e . `` stubborn '' ) , `` strong-willed '' connotes admiration for the level of someone 's will , while `` pig-headed '' connotes frustration in dealing with someone . likewise , `` used car '' and `` previously owned car '' have the same literal meaning , but many dealerships prefer the latter , since it is thought to have fewer `` negative '' `` connotations '' . - it is often useful to avoid words with strong connotations ( especially negative ones ) when striving to achieve a neutral point of view . a desire for more positive connotations , or fewer negative ones , is one of the main reasons for using euphemisms .
