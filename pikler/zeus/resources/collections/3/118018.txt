Telegraphy     telegraphy ( from the greek words `` tele ( τηλε ) '' = far and `` graphein ( γραφειν ) '' = write ) is the long-distance transmission of written messages without physical transport of letters . a telegraph sends electric pulses in a special code , composed from short and large marks . usually , amateur radio operators use morse code . some of the first telegraphs were made in the late 1700s , but these were hard to use because they had too many wires . samuel morse was the first person to make a telegraph using only one wire . in 1844 , he built a telegraph line that went from baltimore to washington , d.c. , and soon , there were telegraphs all over the united states . this made it easier for people to talk to people far away and made it easier for people to move out west . radio telegraphy became widespread in the early 20th century , especially on ships . people would send messages called `` telegrams '' to other people . they would give the message to somebody using a telegraph , who would send the message using morse code . somebody using a telegraph on the other end would write down the message and give it to the person receiving the message . after the 1930s , it became cheaper to make long-distance telephone calls than to send telegrams , so fewer telegrams were sent . western union , an american company that used to send telegrams , sent its last telegram in 2006 .
