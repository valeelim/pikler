Seafloor spreading     seafloor spreading happens at the bottom of an ocean as tectonic plates move apart . the seafloor moves and carries continents with it . at ridges in the middle of oceans , new oceanic crust is created . the motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . at the mid-atlantic ridge ( and other places ) , material from the upper mantle rises through the faults between oceanic plates . it forms new crust as the plates move away from each other . the new crust then slowly moves away from the ridge . seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in plate tectonics . earlier theories ( e.g . by alfred wegener ) of continental drift were that continents 'plowed ' through the ocean . the modern idea is that the ocean floor itself moves and carries the continents with it as it expands from a mid-ocean ridge . today , it is accepted . the phenomenon is caused by convection in the weak upper mantle , or asthenosphere .
