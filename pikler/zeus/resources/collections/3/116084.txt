Wenedyk     wenedyk ( in english : venedic ) is a made-up language . jan van steenbergen , a linguist and translator from the netherlands , made it in 2002. the idea behind it is this : what would have happened if the polish language had developed from latin instead of old slavic ? wenedyk is a possible answer to that question . it is a romance language , so almost all words are family of words in french , italian , romanian , and so on . but they look very different and much more like polish . the rules for spelling and pronunciation are completely based on polish . other parts of the language , like grammar and sentence structure , are a mixture of polish and romance . together with other made-up languages like brithenig ( which does the same thing with welsh ) , wenedyk is part of the group of so-called `` alternative languages '' , languages that could have existed if history had been different . with brithenig , it is the best known example of this sort of languages . wenedyk became known in poland after it was written about on the internet and in the monthly paper `` wiedza i Å¼ycie '' ( `` knowledge and life '' ) .
