Ancient Near East     the ancient near east is the name given to early civilizations within a region roughly corresponding to the modern middle east : mesopotamia ( modern iraq and syria ) , persia ( modern iran ) , anatolia ( modern turkey ) , the levant ( modern syria , lebanon , israel , palestine , and jordan ) , and ancient egypt , from the rise of sumer in the 4th millennium bce until the region 's conquest by alexander the great in the 4th century bce , or covering both the bronze age and the iron age in the region . as such , it is a term widely used in the fields of near eastern archaeology , ancient history and egyptology . some would exclude egypt from the ancient near east as a geographically and culturally distinct area . however , because of egypt 's intimate involvement with the region , especially from the 2nd millennium bce , this exclusion is rare . the ancient near east is considered the cradle of civilization . it was the first to practice intensive year-round agriculture ; it gave the rest of the world the first writing system , invented the potter 's wheel and then the vehicular- and mill wheel , created the first centralized governments , law codes and empires , as well as introducing social stratification , slavery and organized warfare , and it laid the foundation for the fields of astronomy and mathematics .
