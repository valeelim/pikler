National Democratic Party of Germany     the national democratic party ( ) is a right wing political party in germany . it is usually just called the npd . it started after the deutsche reichspartei dissolved in 1964. it is not the same as the old hessian nationaldemokratischen partei . that was one of the parties which joined to form the deutsche reichspartei in 1949. the german government tried to get the npd banned in 2003 , but the bundesverfassungsgericht threw the case out when some of the leaders of the party turned out to be agents or informers of german security services , including the bundesamt f√ºr verfassungsschutz , the `` federal office for the protection of the constitution '' , which still lists the npd as a dangerous organisation because its policies are a threat to the peace and stability of germany and the constitution . the npd is also referred to as being neo-nazi , as it openly opposes turks , blacks , gays and jews .
