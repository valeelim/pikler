Optical depth     optical depth is a measure of transparency . it is defined as the fraction of radiation ( or light ) that is scattered or absorbed on a path . one way of visualizing optical depth is to think of a fog . the fog between a person and an object that is immediately in front of them has an optical depth of zero . as the object moves away , the optical depth increases until it reaches a large value and the object is no longer visible . other websites . - optical depth equations
