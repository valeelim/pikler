Society of Jesus     the society of jesus ( latin : `` societas iesu '' , `` s.j . '' and `` s.i . '' or `` sj '' , `` si '' ) is a roman catholic church religious order whose members are called jesuits , `` soldiers of christ '' , and `` foot soldiers of the pope '' , because the founder , saint ignatius of loyola , was a knight before becoming a priest . jesuits are the largest male religious order of the roman catholic church with 19,216 members ( 13,491 priests , 3,049 scholastic students , 1,810 brothers and 866 novices ) . the society of jesus is consecrated under the patronage of the madonna della strada . it is led by a superior general , currently adolfo nicol√°s . the headquarters of the society , its general curia , is in rome . within the catholic church , there has been a sometimes tense relationship between jesuits and the vatican . this is due to questioning of official church teaching and papal directives , such as those on abortion , birth control , women deacons , homosexuality , and liberation theology . however , as of 2013 , the current pope , pope francis , is a jesuit himself .
