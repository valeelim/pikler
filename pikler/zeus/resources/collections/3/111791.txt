Scanning tunneling microscope     scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) is a way to view atoms . it was developed in 1981. it was invented by gerd binnig and heinrich rohrer at ibm z√ºrich . they won the nobel prize in physics for inventing it in 1986. for stm , good resolution is 0.1 nm lateral resolution ( how accurately it can see features on the surface ) and 0.01 nm depth resolution ( how accurately it can see the height of bumps on the surface ) . the stm can be used not only in a vacuum but also in air and various other liquids or gases , and at most common temperatures . the stm is based on quantum tunneling . when a metal tip is brought very near to a metal or semiconducting surface , a voltage between the two can allow electrons to flow through the vacuum between them . changes in current as the probe goes over the surface is what makes the picture . stm can be a hard thing to do , as it needs very clean surfaces and sharp tips . first the tip is brought very close to the thing being looked at , about 4-7 angstroms . then the tip is moved very carefully across the thing being tested . this change in current when it is moved can be measured ( constant height mode ) . the height of the tip where it always has the same current can be measured , too ( constant current mode ) . using a constant height mode is faster .
