Querétaro     querétaro is a state of mexico . the word querétaro dates back to pre-hispanic times . some of the people who arrived in the area now occupied by the state gave it different names based on its geographic features . the tarascans of michoacán called the spot now known as la cañada , crettaro or queréndaro , which means the place of the crags ; they probably gave it this name because there is lots of pink stone there . the otomíes called it mxei , which means the place where the ballgame is played . it was also called ndamaxei , which means the great ballcourt ; the aztecs named it tlaxco , which has the same meaning . finally , the chichimecs called this spot xico , which also means great ballcourt in their language ; it received this name because the la cañada area is shaped like an enormous pre-hispanic ballcourt .
