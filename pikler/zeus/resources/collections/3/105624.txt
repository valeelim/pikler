Level crossing     a level crossing ( also called a grade crossing , a railway crossing , or a railroad crossing ) is a place where a railway line and a road meet each other on the same level . this means that the grades ( the road and the track ) are not separated by using a bridge or a tunnel . usually , there are signs indicating the crossing . there may also be barriers/gates that go down before a train passes . depending on how much traffic there is , there are different measures to make the crossing more secure : - signs or panels , indicating the crossing - blinking or steady lights - sounds ( usually a warning bell ) - gates/barriers that are lowered before a train passes since level crossings are dangerous ( there are many accidents ) , they are usually grade separated once there is more traffic , or high speed trains . related pages . - billups neon crossing signal
