Cenote     a cenote is a type of sinkhole that contains groundwater . it is typical in the mexican yucatán peninsula and some nearby caribbean islands . the term comes from a word used by the lowland yucatec maya to refer to any location where groundwater can be got at . cenotes are surface connections to underground water bodies . while the most well-known cenotes are large open water pools measuring tens of metres in diameter , such as those at chichén itzá , most cenotes are smaller sheltered sites and do not necessarily have any surface exposed water . the term cenote has also been used to describe similar karst features in other countries such as cuba and australia , in addition to the more generic term of sinkholes . cenote water is often very clear , as the water comes from rain water infiltrating slowly through the ground . the groundwater flow rate within a cenote may be very slow at velocities ranging from 1 to 1000 meters per year . cenotes around the world attract cave divers . they have explored extensive flooded cave systems , some of which have been investigated for 100 kilometers or more .
