Fluid mechanics     fluid mechanics is the study of how fluids move and the forces on them . ( fluids include liquids and gases . ) fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid statics , the study of fluids at rest , and fluid dynamics , the study of fluids in motion . it is a branch of continuum mechanics , a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms . the study of fluid mechanics goes back at least to the days of ancient greece , when archimedes made a beginning on fluid statics . however , fluid mechanics , especially fluid dynamics , is an active field of research with many unsolved or partly solved problems . fluid mechanics can be mathematically complex . sometimes it can best be solved by numerical analysis , typically using computers . a modern discipline , called `` computational fluid dynamics '' ( cfd ) , is devoted to this approach to solving fluid mechanics problems . fluid mechanics is a subdiscipline of continuum mechanics , as illustrated in the following table .
