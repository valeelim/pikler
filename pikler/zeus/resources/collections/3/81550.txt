Pterodaustro     pterodaustro was a pterosaur . it is found in the lower cretaceous of south america . `` pterodaustro '' most likely fed on tiny invertebrates : zooplankton and krill . pterodaustro was medium sized , having a wing-span about two meters in length and having only been found in brazil . `` pterodaustro '' probably waded in shallow water like flamingos , straining food with its tooth comb , a method called `` filter feeding '' . once it caught its food , `` pterodaustro '' probably mashed it with the small , globular teeth present in its upper jaw . at least two specimens have been found with gizzard stones in the stomach cavity , the first ever reported for any pterosaur . these clusters of small stones with angled edges support the idea that `` pterodaustro '' ate mainly small , hard-shelled aquatic crustaceans using filter-feeding . such invertebrates are abundant in the sediment of the fossil site in 2004 a `` pterodaustro '' embryo in an egg was reported . the egg was elongated , six centimetres long and 22 millimetres across and its mainly flexible shell was covered with a thin layer , 0.3 mm thick , of calcite .
