Right triangle     a right triangle , ( also called a right-angled triangle ) , has one angle that is 90 degrees . the other two angles always add up to 90 degrees but can be different sizes . the side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse ; it is the longest side in the right triangle . the other two sides are the legs or catheti ( singular : cathetus ) of the triangle . missing sides or angles of a right triangle can be found using trigonometry , the pythagorean theorem , and many other ways . in any triangle all the angles add up to 180 degrees .
