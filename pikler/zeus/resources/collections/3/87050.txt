Space (physics)    space ( physics ) space , in everyday language , is something that we all know . it is measured in the three dimensions of distance : length , width , and height . in modern physics , space is a `` boundless four-dimensional continuum '' known as spacetime . disagreement exist about whether it is an entity ( something that actually exists ) . it may be just a relationship between entities , or part of a conceptual framework . the standard space interval , called a metre ( or meter ) , is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of about 1/300,000,000 of a second . before einstein 's work on relativistic physics , time and space were viewed as independent dimensions . einstein 's discoveries have shown that due to relativity of motion space and time can be mathematically combined into space-time .
