Adrian Willaert     adrian willaert ( pronounce : ah-dree-ahn vil-art ) , ( born flanders about 1490 ; died venice , 7 december 1562 ) was a flemish composer in the renaissance period . he was one of the most important composers of his time . he went to italy when he was young and spent the rest of his life there . he belonged to the group of composers who lived and worked in venice at the time , and who were known as the “ venetian school ” . he may have been born in bruges which is now in belgium , although we are not sure . one of his students , gioseffo zarlino , who became a well-known music theorist , said that willaert went to paris first to study law , but then decided to study music . in paris he met jean mouton , the main composer of the french royal chapel , and studied with him . mouton taught him to write music in the style of josquin , whose music was very polyphonic with the voices imitating one another a lot . sometime around 1515 willaert first went to rome . there is a story , which is probably true , that willaert was surprised to find the pope ’ s choir singing something he had composed . the choir thought it had been composed by josquin , who was very famous by then . when the young willaert told them that he himself was the composer , the choir did not believe the young man , and refused to sing it again .
