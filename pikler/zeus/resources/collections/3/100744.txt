Microformat     a microformat is an attempt to re-use existing content in html and xml documents . such content may be information on how to contact someone , or it may be geographical coordinates , for example . this information can then be processed by software more easily . technically , this kind of information is already there . a microformat aims at making this information accessible more easily . that way , tags might be added to flag the information . in this example , the contact information is presented as follows : with hcard microformat markup , that becomes : here , the formatted name ( `` fn '' ) , organisation ( `` org '' ) , telephone number ( `` tel '' ) and web address ( `` url '' ) have been identified using specific class names and the whole thing is wrapped in codice_1 , which indicates that the other classes form an hcard ( short for `` html vcard '' ) and are not merely coincidentally named . other , optional , hcard classes also exist . it is now possible for software , such as browser plug-ins , to extract the information , and transfer it to other applications , such as an address book .
