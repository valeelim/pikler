Time server     a time server is a special computer in a computer network . it is important that computers on a network have a common idea of time . time servers are computers with special software on them . they either use an atomic clock , or they ask other computers on the network about the time . they then make this time available to all the other computers in the same network . common protocols used to do this are the daytime protocol and the network time protocol ( ntp ) . ntp calls the quality of a time server its stratum . stratum can be anything form 0 to 255 and lower is better . it is rare to see a network with a source worse than stratum 5 . - stratum 0 time sources are the actual clocks that track the time , usually an atomic clock or gps receiver . - stratum 1 time sources are what most people mean when they talk about a time server . they get their timing information from a master clock and send it out to the network . - stratum 2 time sources are computers that get their clock information from a stratum 1 time server . they use ntp to talk to each other as well as their stratum 1 servers so they can have the best time information possible .
