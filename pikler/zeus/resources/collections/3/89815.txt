Triple-Zero     triple-zero ( 000 ) is the national emergency number within australia . if someone has an emergency situation that is life threatening or time critical , this number will connect them to a telstra operator who will then connect them to the police , fire or ambulance service as required . 112 is a secondary emergency number that will direct calls to the triple zero answering point . it is against the law to use this number if there is no emergency . before 1961 , australia did not have a national number for emergency services ; each of the different emergency branches ( police , fire department or ambulance ) had their own number . in 1961 , the postmaster general ( pmg ) introduced the triple zero ( 000 ) number in most of the major australian cities and by the end of the 1980s it had become nation-wide . the number triple zero ( 000 ) was chosen for several reasons , one of which was that it was easy to dial in darkness because the number zero was next to the finger stop on most australian telephones .
