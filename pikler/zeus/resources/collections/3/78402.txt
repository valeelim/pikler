Positron     a positron is the antimatter version of an electron . it has the same mass and spin as an electron . however , it has a positive charge , whereas an electron has a negative charge . like all antimatter , when it meets its so-called counterpartner , each are annihilated and turned into energy . the electron and positron disappear , and the total mass decreases . there is no name for this type of energy , as it is neither mechanical , radiation , chemical , electrical , nuclear , nor thermal . although the energy does emit light photons when annihilated , it is converted from some form of energy that has not been named . a positron also very rarely makes a structure called positronium . positronium is like an atom in many ways , but is very unstable , and usually quickly annihilates . other websites . - what is antimatter ? what is a positron ?
