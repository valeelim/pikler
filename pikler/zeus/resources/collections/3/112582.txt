Termite     termites are an suborder of social insects , the isoptera . they are sometimes called `` '' white ants '' '' , incorrectly , because ants belong to the order hymenoptera . they are `` eusocial '' animals , as are ants and some bees and wasps . termites mostly feed on detritus , mostly wood , leaf litter , soil , or animal dung . there are an estimated 4,000 species ( about 2,600 taxonomically known ) . about 10 % are pests which can cause serious structural damage to buildings , crops or plantation forests . termites are major detrivores in the subtropical and tropical regions . their recycling of wood and other plant matter is very important for ecology . a termite colony starts when winged termites ( called `` alates '' ) swarm and mate . after mating , they fall to the ground and rip off their wings . the female looks for a good place to start the colony , and the male follows her . most termites nest underground their entire lives , but termites in africa and australia actually build really big mound structures that look like little mountains and can be more than 20 feet tall ( see photo below ) .
