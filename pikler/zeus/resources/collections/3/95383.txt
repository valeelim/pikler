Octal     the octal numeral system is a base 8 numeral system . it uses the numerals 0 through 7. the system is similar to binary ( base 2 ) and hexadecimal ( base 16 ) . octal numerals are written using the letter `` o '' before the numeral , for example , o04 or o1242 . at one time , the octal system was used mainly for work with computers . it provided an easier way to work with binary numbers . as computers changed from using 24-bit systems to 32- and 64-bit systems , hexadecimal replaced octal for most uses . certain groups , for example , native americans using the yuki language in california and the pamean languages in mexico , also use an octal numbering system . they do this because when they count , they use the spaces between their fingers instead of counting the actual fingers . the octal numeral system uses a three-bit binary coding . each digit in an octal numeral is the same as three digits in a binary numeral . the grouping of the binary digits is done from right to left . the first three binary digits from the right are grouped into the last part of the octal numeral , then the next three digits form the next to the last part of the numeral .
