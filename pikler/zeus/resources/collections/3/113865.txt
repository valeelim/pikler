Good (philosophy)    good ( philosophy ) in philosophy , something is good if it is important or valuable . objects ( things ) , people , ideas , and actions can be good . many philosophers ( people who study philosophy ) have thought about what it means for something to be good . this issue is also called value . an economic good can become more or less valuable over time . this is because an economic good is valuable because people will give up something ( usually money ) for it . a philosophical good is always good , even if there are no people to see it . this is because philosophical goods are good because of something in themselves . goods can be absolute or relative . a relative good is something that is good because people say it is good . an absolute good is something that is good because of something in itself . it is good even if there is no one around to see it . for example , an economist may say that the mona lisa is a very valuable economic good because it can be sold for a lot of money . a philosopher may say that the painting is good because of how it is painted . the economist sees relative good , because people may later not want to pay for it . the philosopher sees absolute good , because it will always be painted well .
