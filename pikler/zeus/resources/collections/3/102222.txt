Cathar castles     cathar castles ( `` châteaux cathares '' in french ) is a term used by the french tourist industry ; it used for castles in the languedoc-roussillon , usually built during the crusades against the cathars . the cathars built fortified homesteads . some of them were laurac , fanjeaux , mas-saintes-puelles . certain sites like lastours-cabaret , montségur , termes or puilaurens were `` castra '' before being razed to the ground and becoming royal citadels . the legend of cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth . the only monuments which witnessed the events of the first half of the 13th century . the cathar church did not build anything . for this reason , the only ones which can claim the description `` cathar '' are the small castles , often totally unknown to the public . their unspectacular ruins are often far-away from tourist routes . because raimond ii was unable to recapture carcassone in 1240 , the city walls were strengthened by the french king . he also destroyed small `` castra '' in the corbières region and built citadels to protect the frontier with the kingdom of aragon .
