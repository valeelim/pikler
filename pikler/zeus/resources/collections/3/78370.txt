Rounders     rounders is a sport which originated in great britain and ireland . the game is regulated by the `` gaelic athletic association '' ( gaa ) in ireland and the `` national rounders association '' ( nra ) in the uk . both have different , although broadly similar , game-play and culture . competitions are held between teams from `` both '' traditions , often with one version being played in the morning and the other being played in the afternoon . game-play centers around innings where teams act at turns being batters and fielders . a maximum of nine players are allowed to play in fielding positions at one time . points ( `` rounders '' ) are scored by the batting team by completing a circuit around the field through four bases/posts without being put 'out ' - for example , by a ball they batted being 'caught-out ' or touching a tagged base/post . the earliest nationally formalised rules of play were devised by the gaa in ireland in 1884. although it is generally considered a school game , rounders is played at international level as well . currently , teams from canada , england , ireland , the isle of man , scotland and wales compete against each other .
