Transformer     a transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another through mutual electromagnetic induction ) and without change in frequency . transformers are an important part of electrical systems . transformers are made in many different sizes , from a very small coupling transformer inside a stage microphone to big units that carry hundreds of mva used in power grids . the main reason to use a transformer is to make power of one voltage level into power of another voltage level . high voltage is easier to send a long distance , but less voltage is easier and safer to use in the office or home . transformers are used to increase or decrease alternating current ( ac ) voltage in circuits . the transformer is usually built with two coils around the same core . the primary coil or input coil is connected to supply side while secondary coil supplies power to load . the second one is called the output coil . energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary by electromagnetism . in power grids many transformers are used . these are networks for delivering electricity from the generator and to the user .
