Courts of Germany     the judiciary , that is , the judges and courts of germany are independent . they are not controlled by the federal government or the state governments . there are laws which say what sort of cases the courts can hear and pass judgment on , and what type of punishment a court can give . but no law or minister can say that a person is guilty . only the courts can do this . courts give protection to ordinary people from bad governments , they are also protected from bad governments themselves . germany has had free courts for longer than it has been a democracy , although under the nazis many judges ignored the law and did what the nazi party wanted . this is why they were tried at the nuremberg judges trial germany is a `` rechtsstaat '' . that means it is a government based on law . all citizens are guaranteed to be equal , and government decisions can be challenged in court . no law or minister can say that a person , or group of people is guilty . federal law sets out the structure of the judiciary . running courts is up to the länder . the länder ( `` states of germany '' ) are run the lower levels of the court system ; only the highest courts are paid for by the federal government .
