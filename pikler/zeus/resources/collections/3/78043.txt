Coelacanth     a coelacanth is a type of fish in the sarcopterygii , the lobe-finned fishes . they are a sister group to those fish which evolved into tetrapods . their fossil record goes back 400 million years , before any land vertebrates had evolved . coelacanths were thought to have been extinct for 80 million years , but in fact two species survived , living in the indian ocean . the first to be discovered was caught alive off the east african coast in 1938. the coelacanths are the closest link between fish and the first amphibians which made the transition from sea to land in the devonian period ( 408â€“362 million years ago ) . whereas the fishapods lived near the shore in muddy water , the coelacanths lived in open water . the modern species are predators live in the deep ocean . `` latimeria '' is the only living genus of the otherwise fossil coelacanth fish . it is probably the best-known lazarus taxon . that such a creature could have been unrecorded for so long is rare , but perhaps the cold depths of the west indian ocean ( in which the coelacanth lives ) , and the few predators it has , may have helped the species survive . its disgusting taste means that fishermen did not deliberately try to catch it , that is , before scientists started offering rewards .
