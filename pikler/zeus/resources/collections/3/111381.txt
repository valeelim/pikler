Walrus     a walrus is a marine mammal , the only species of the family odobenidae , which is one of the three pinniped families . they live in the cold northern seas around north america and europe . walruses have lots of things similar to true seals and eared seals . like true seals , they just have a hole for an ear - not ear flaps . like eared seals , they can rotate their back flippers forward to walk on land . like both true seals and eared seals , they are very good swimmers and divers . however , walruses do have some features that neither true seals nor eared seals have . the most famous thing about walruses are their `` tusks '' . even though they are called tusks , they are actually teeth growing out of their mouth , a bit like the narwhal . the tusks grow for about 15 years before they reach their full length , which is about for males and for females . both the male and female walrus grow tusks . they can use it to protect themselves from polar bears and killer whales , and use them when the eat . when they eat bigger prey such as seals and small whales , they first tear them apart with their tusks to make them easier to eat . another important use of a walrus 's tusks is to pull itself out onto the ice . pushing its tusks into the ice , the walrus gets extra help hauling its huge body out of the sea . this is probably how walruses got their family name `` odobenidae '' , which comes from greek words meaning `` one that walks with teeth '' . they do not walk with their teeth , but it can look as if they do when they pull themselves out of the water . their tusks can also be used to cut holes in the ice . tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males , who use them for fighting , dominance and display ; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups . tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice .
