Binomial expansion     binomial expansion uses an expression to make a series . it uses a bracket expression like formula_1 . there are three binomial expansions . there are basically three binomial expansion formulas : we can explain why there are such 3 formulas with a simple expansion of the product : if formula_5 is an integer ( formula_6 ) , we use pascal 's triangle . to expand formula_7 : - find row 2 of pascal 's triangle ( 1 , 2 , 1 ) - expand formula_8 and formula_9 so the formula_8 power goes down by 1 each time from formula_5 to 0 and the formula_9 power goes up by 1 each time from 0 up to formula_5 - times the numbers from pascal 's triangle with the right terms . so formula_14 for example : so as a rule : where formula_17 is the number at row formula_5 and position formula_19 in pascal 's triangle .
