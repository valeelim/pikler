Fives     fives is a british sport believed to come from the same origins as many racket sports . in fives , a ball is propelled against the walls of a special court using gloved or bare hands as though they were a racquet . the name may be derived from the slang expression `` a bunch of fives '' ( meaning a fist ) . the game has also been known as hand-tennis and historically was often played between the buttresses of church buildings in england . there are links between fives and the irish and north american handball games and indeed , in recent years , british clubs have begun to establish ties with clubs in those countries . fives is not the same as long fives , which is played in a real tennis court . there are two main forms of the game rugby fives and eton fives . eton fives is played competitively as a doubles game , whilst rugby fives is played as both a singles and a doubles game . other websites . - eton fives - rugby fives association ( uk ) - cambridge university rugby fives club - executioners ( a london fives club )
