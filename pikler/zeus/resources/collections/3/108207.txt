Giotto di Bondone     giotto di bondone ( c.1267â€“january 8 1337 ) , usually known as giotto , was an italian painter and architect from florence . he is generally thought of as the first in a line of great artists of the italian renaissance . giovanni villani , who lived at the same time as giotto , wrote that he was the king of painters , who drew all his figures as if they were alive . villani says that , because he was so clever , the city of florence gave him a salary . in the 16th century , the biographer giorgio vasari says that giotto changed painting from the byzantine style of other artists of his day , and brought to life the great art of painting as it was made by the later renaissance painters like leonardo da vinci . this was because giotto drew his figures from life , rather than copying the style them from old well-known pictures in the way that the byzantine artists like cimabue and duccio did . giotto 's greatest work is the decoration of the `` scrovegni chapel '' in padua , finished around 1305. the building is sometimes called the `` arena chapel '' because it is on the site of an ancient roman arena . this fresco series shows the life of the virgin and the life of christ . it is thought of as one of the greatest masterpieces of the early renaissance .
