Voluntary (music)    voluntary ( music ) in music a voluntary is a piece of music , usually for organ , which is played as part of a church service . the word “ voluntary ” can be used for the title of a piece of music . the title was often used by english composers in the late renaissance or baroque periods for a piece of organ music that was free in style , i.e . it did not have to be composed in a strict form such as sonata form or a fugue . it was meant to sound as if it was being improvised ( the word voluntary in general means “ free ” , i.e . not “ forced to do something ” ) . composers such as orlando gibbons , john blow and henry purcell wrote voluntaries , although sometimes they preferred to use other titles such as `` fancy '' ( an english form of the italian word `` fantasia '' ) , or even `` fugue '' . however , these `` fugues '' were not composed in the proper fugue style : they just started off with imitation as in a fugue , but continued in a freer style . some voluntaries were called `` double voluntaries '' . these were pieces written for organs with two manuals ( keyboards ) . the pieces contrasted a loud manual with a soft one .
