C-pop     c-pop is short for chinese popular music ( ) . most of today 's c-pop artists are from hong kong , taiwan and mainland china , as well as from other countries where mandarin or cantonese language is used , such as singapore and malaysia . however , taiwanese music has some origins from the japanese enka so taiwanese pop is sometimes said to be a different genre from c-pop . cantonese pop , or colloquially known as cantopop , is a subgenre of c-pop , sung in cantonese language . most hong kong-born singers start off as cantonese pop singers before starting a career as a mandarin pop singer . cantonese pop artists include : - aaron kwok - andy lau - candy lo - coco lee - jacky cheung - leon lai - alan tam - leslie cheung - samuel hui - priscilla chan - joseph koo `` the four heavenly kings '' of cantonese pop are leon lai , andy lau , aaron kwok and jacky cheung . in the early 1990s , many major cantonese pop stars ( such as alan tam , leslie cheung , samuel hui , priscilla chan and joseph koo ) decided to retire because of the protests in china in 1989. cantonese pop needed new talent to fill the gaps left by these retired stars , this led to the beginning of `` the four heavenly kings '' or `` 四大天王 '' ( `` lit . '' four great kings of heaven ) : jacky jeung , andy lau , aaron kwok and leon lai . they were dominating the media in all forms , from magazines , tv , cinema to music .
