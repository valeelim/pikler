Cannon     a cannon is a type of artillery , or large gun . they are made with a large tube called `` barrel '' , and shoot projectiles . cannons were first made in china , and were used with another chinese invention , gunpowder . the gunpowder was put at the back of the tube , and the projectile , usually a cannonball , was placed in front . the gunpowder was set on fire , and would explode . this pushed the cannonball out the front of the tube towards the enemy . howitzers and mortars are similar to cannons but they have shorter barrels and shoot the balls higher .
