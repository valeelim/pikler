Piltdown Man     piltdown man ( `` eoanthropus dawsoni '' ) was once thought to be a `` missing link '' between man and ape . the first piltdown fragments were discovered in 1912. thereafter , over 500 scientific essays were written on the piltdown man in a 40-year period . the discovery was proven to be a deliberate hoax in 1953. piltdown man consisted of two human skulls , an orangutan jaw , an elephant molar , a hippopotamus tooth , and a canine tooth from a chimpanzee . sir kenneth oakley has determined the human skulls to be approximately 620 years old . they may have belonged to ona indians from patagonia , as the skulls were unusually thick . thick skulls are a common trait among ona indians . the orangutan jaw is around 500 years old , perhaps from sarawak . the elephant molar is thought to be from tunisia . the hippopotamus tooth is thought to have come from malta or perhaps sicily . the canine tooth belonged to a pleistocene chimpanzee . the piltdown remains were purposefully scattered around a quarry in piltdown , england , so that they could be `` discovered '' later as evidence for evolution and the development of man from ape . the skulls had been treated with acid . all of the fossil remains were stained with an iron sulfate solution . the canine tooth was painted brown and patched with bubble gum . the molars were filed down . the portion of the orangutan jaw that connected the jaw to its skull was carefully broken so as not to show evidence that this jaw did not belong to a human skull .
