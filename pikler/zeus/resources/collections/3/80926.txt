Supersonic     the term supersonic is used to describe a speed that is over the speed of sound ( mach 1 ) . at a normal temperature like 70 degrees fahrenheit ( 21.1 Â°c ) , the speed needed for something to be traveling at a faster than sound speed is about 344 m/s , 1,129 ft/s , 770 mph or 1,238 km/h . speeds faster than 5 times the speed of sound are sometimes called hypersonic . speeds where only some parts of the air around an object ( like the propellor ) reach supersonic speeds are called transonic ( normally somewhere between mach 0.8 and mach 1.2 ) . it can be very hard to reach supersonic speeds , because drag increases a lot near these speeds . this slows a plane , and for years made control difficult . these problems were called the `` sound barrier '' . jet engines and other developments solved the problems in the middle 20th century .
