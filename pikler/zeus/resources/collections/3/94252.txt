Puritanism     the puritans were a group of english-speaking protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries . puritans thought that the english reformation had not gone far enough . they also did not agree with some of the things the church of england did . king henry viii separated from the roman catholic church in 1534 and established the protestant church of england . this church remained until 1553. queen mary returned the church to be roman catholic until 1558 when elizabeth i of england became queen . since she was a protestant many people were happy but thought that the church had not changed enough and was still too much like catholicism . a puritan was any person who tried to become more pure through worship and doctrine . the puritans ' way of life and set of beliefs were called puritanism . the most important parts of puritanism were piety ( obeying religious rules ) , dressing simply , and living a modest life . the puritans believed some of the same things as calvinists and scottish presbyterians . all of these groups were devoted to the bible and to being morally pure .
