Fiberglass     fiberglass ( also called fibreglass and glass fibre ) is material made from extremely fine fibers of glass . it is used as a reinforcing material for many polymer products . the composite material , that is produced by this method is called `` fiberglass '' in popular usage . the proper names are fiber-reinforced polymer ( frp ) or glass-reinforced plastic ( grp ) . glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers , but mass manufacture of fiberglass was only made possible when finer tools for machines were produced . glass fiber is formed when thin of silica-based or other formulation glass is extruded into many fibers with small diameters that are suitable for textile processing . glass is unlike other polymers because , even as a fiber , it has little crystalline structure ( see amorphous solid ) . the properties of the structure of glass in its soft stage are very much like its properties when spun into fiber . bare fiberglass can cause skin irritation and cuts when handled without gloves . there have been concerns that fiberglass can be accidentally inhaled into the lungs , where it can cause cancer and other lung problems , similar to asbestos . fiberglass has been called `` man-made asbestos '' . substitutes for fiberglass building insulation , such as cellulose and aerogel , have started to appear .
