Mammaliaformes     mammaliaformes ( `` mammal-like '' ) is a clade which contains the mammals and their closest extinct relatives . living members of the clade include the monotremes ( monotremata ) , marsupials ( marsupialia ) and the eutherians ( placentalia ) . mammaliforms have highly specialized molar teeth , with cusps and flat regions for grinding food . this is a single inherited system in present mammals , but it seems to have evolved convergently in pre-mammals more than once . instead of having many teeth that are frequently replaced , mammals have one set of baby teeth and later one set of adult teeth which fit together precisely . this may help to grind food , and make it easier to digest . lactation ( milk ) and fur , along with other features , also characterize the mammaliaformes , though these traits are difficult to study in the fossil record . the fossilized remains of `` castorocauda lutrasimilis '' are an exception to this . fossils of mesozoic proto-mammals were very scarce . there were only 116 in 1979 , but this has changed in recent times . there were about 310 in 2007 , with an increase in quality so that there are `` at least 18 mesozoic mammals [ with ] nearly complete skeletons '' .
