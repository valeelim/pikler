Acanthopholis     acanthopolis ( meaning `` spiny scales '' ) was an armoured ankylosaurian dinosaur . this quadrupedal ( walked on four legs ) , plant-eating dinosaur had its armour in rows of oval plates set into its skin . it also had spikes jutting out of its neck and shoulder area along the spine . it was about 15 feet long ( 4 m ) and weighed roughly 380 kg . the first specimen was found in 1865 by fossil collector john griffiths on the shoreline at folkestone . the stratum was cambridge greensand , a formation in the lower cretaceous of southern england . at the time england was part of a huge tropical river delta , and the greensand was laid down just offshore . it seems that dinosaurs were on the shoreline or the river delta , and sometimes their bodies washed out to sea . references . - carpenter , kenneth 2001. phylogenetic analysis of ankylosauria . in carpenter , kenneth ( ed ) : `` the armored dinosaurs '' . indiana university press , 455â€“480 . isbn 0-253-33964-2
