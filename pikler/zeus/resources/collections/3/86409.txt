Gnosticism     gnosticism comes from the which means knowledge . some religions and sects mostly in the few hundred years before and after jesus are said to be gnostic or practice gnosticism . this is because these religions believe that there is a special , hidden knowledge that only a few people may have . there are two problems finding out a lot about believers in gnosticism : 1. most gnostic teachings were secret or hidden ( occult ) ; 1. most of what we know about gnostics come from attacks written by non-gnostic christians . gnosticism says that humans are divine souls trapped in the ordinary physical ( or `` material '' ) world . they say that the world was made by an imperfect spirit . the imperfect spirit is thought to be the same as the god of abraham . the imperfect spirit may be seen as evil , or sometimes just not perfect but doing the best it can . the real god who is good , is distant and not easy to know . in order to get free from the material world , a person has to get `` gnosis '' . that is the special secret knowledge given only to a few special people .
