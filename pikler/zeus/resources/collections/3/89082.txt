Republic of Lakotah     a group of native americans decided to call the place where they live the republic of lakotah . this group is called the `` lakotah freedom delegation '' . they believe the republic of lakotah should be treated as a separate country , but at the moment , no other country in the world agrees that it is . when white people first came to north america from europe , the lakotah people , who are a native tribe , had already been living there for thousands of years . the lakotah legally had nothing to do with the usa until they made treaties ( agreements ) with each other in the 1800s . since then , the lakotah people have lived inside the borders of the usa . on december 17 , 2007 , the lakotah freedom delegation said that lakotah should become a separate country again , as it was before they made treaties with the usa . they drew up borders , which includes bits of north and south dakota , nebraska , wyoming and montana . at the moment , most people consider these regions still to belong to the usa .
