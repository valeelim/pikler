Strict construction     strict construction means a restriction of judicial interpretation . in the united states the phrase is also commonly used more loosely as a term for conservativism among the judiciary . in its strict sense , strict construction requires a judge to apply the text as it is written and no farther , if the meaning of the text is clear . that is , judges should avoid drawing from a statute or constitution . for example , justice hugo black argued that the first amendment 's that `` congress shall make no law , '' should be construed strictly : the term `` no law , '' black thought , admitted virtually no exceptions .
