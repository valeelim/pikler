Hipparchus     hipparchus ( greek ; ca . 190 bc â€“ ca . 120 bc ) was a greek astronomer , geographer , and mathematician . he lived in the hellenistic period . hipparchus was born in nicaea ( now iznik , turkey ) , and probably died on the island of rhodes . he worked as an astronomer at least from 147 bc to 127 bc . hipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer . some people see him as the greatest overall astronomer of antiquity . he was the first greek whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the sun and moon survive . to get to these models , he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the chaldeans from babylonia . he had a trigonometric table . it looks like he solved some problems of spherical trigonometry with the table . with his solar and lunar theories and his trigonometry , he was perhaps the first to develop a reliable method to predict solar eclipses . his other well-known achievements include the discovery of precession , the compilation of the first comprehensive star catalog of the western world , and possibly the invention of the astrolabe . he might also have invented the armillary sphere which first appeared during his century and was used by him during the creation of much of the star catalogue . it would be three centuries before claudius ptolemaeus ' synthesis of astronomy would make the work of hipparchus obsolete ; it is heavily dependent on it in many areas .
