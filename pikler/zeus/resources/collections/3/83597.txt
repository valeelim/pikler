Nuremberg Trials     there were two sets of nuremberg trials . the first , and most well known , were the trials of the leaders of nazi germany . this was organized by the international military tribunal ( imt ) . the judges and prosecutors were from the four wartime allies , france , the ussr , the united kingdom and the united states . the second set of trials were the 12 `` follow up trials '' ( ) . these trials were of groups of lower-ranking nazis , like doctors , and officials of the german foreign office . although the follow up trials were held in the same courtroom as the imt trials , they were run by the americans alone . the original plan was for the imt to hold several trials , and the allies to hold their own trials of local officials as well . cooperation between the soviet union and the western allies quickly broke down . the imt only held the one big trial . so the us held trials of the next most important nazis themselves . the international military tribunal was opened on october 18 , 1945 , in the supreme court building in berlin . the first session was presided over by the soviet judge , nikitchenko . the prosecution brought charges against 24 major war criminals and six criminal organizations â€“ the leadership of the nazi party , the schutzstaffel ( ss ) and sicherheitsdienst ( sd ) , the gestapo , the sturmabteilung ( sa ) and the high command of the german armed forces ( okw ) .
