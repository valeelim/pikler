ECAC Hockey     ecac hockey is a group of colleges and universities in the northeastern united states who play ncaa division i hockey against one another every season.. it is the only ncaa division i hockey conference whose members all have varsity men 's and women 's teams . the league 's champions are automatically invited to the ncaa division i men 's and women 's hockey tournaments . another unique feature of the conference is its unofficial relationship with another conference , the ivy league . six of the ivy league 's eight schools have both men 's and women 's hockey teams ; all six are members of ecac hockey . although the ivy league does not officially sponsor hockey , it still has a conference hockey championâ€”it uses the results of its members in ecac hockey to determine a winner . during the major hockey conference realignment of 2011 and 2012 triggered by the decision of the big ten conference to start a men 's hockey league in 2013 , the ecac was the only division i men 's hockey conference that neither gained nor lost a member .
