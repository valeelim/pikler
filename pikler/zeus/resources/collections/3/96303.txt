Feldspar     feldspar is the name of a group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals that make up as much as 60 % of the earth 's crust . feldspar forms crystals from magma in both intrusive and extrusive rocks , and they can also happen as compact minerals , as veins , and are also present in many types of metamorphic rock . rock formed entirely of plagioclase feldspar is known as anorthosite . feldspar is also found in many types of sedimentary rock . feldspar is typically reddish or pale pink in color , and has a hardness of 6 on the mohs scale , making it roughly as hard to scratch as glass . there are two groups of feldspar , both made out of silica and aluminum : 1 . `` orthoclase or `` alkali '' feldspars '' : a group of minerals that all have the same formula ( kalsio with sodium sometimes replacing the potassium in some pieces ) , but are formed in different ways because of how different the times and places where they formed were . 1 . `` plagioclase feldspars '' : a series of minerals that are made up of a series of two chemicals ( albite , naalsio , and anorthite caalsio ) , with a given piece having its place on the series determined by the relative amounts of the two chemicals .
