Continental United States     the continental united states is the area of the united states of america that is located in the continent of north america . it includes 49 of the 50 states ( 48 of which are located south of canada and north of mexico , known as the `` lower 48 states '' , the other being alaska ) and the district of columbia , which contains the federal capital , washington , d.c. the only state which is not part of this is hawaii ( as they are islands in the pacific ocean and not part of north america ) . some sources incorrectly mix up the `` continental united states '' with the `` contiguous united states '' ( which consists simply of the lower 48 states and the district of columbia ) . the contiguous united states does not include alaska , hawaii , or any other territories under the control of the united states . alaska is unique among the us states as it is part of the north american continent , meaning it is attached via canada , and so is part of the `` continental united states '' . however , alaska is not part of the `` contiguous united states '' , because it is not attached directly to the lower 48 states .
