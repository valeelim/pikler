Goldbach's conjecture    goldbach 's conjecture goldbach 's conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics . it states : on 7 june 1742 , the prussian mathematician christian goldbach wrote a letter to leonhard euler in which he suggested the following conjecture , which would later be called goldbach 's strong conjecture : he considered 1 to be a prime number , a convention subsequently abandoned . a weaker version of goldbach 's original conjecture is : this is called goldbach 's weak conjecture . euler , becoming interested in the problem , wrote back to goldbach saying that the weak conjecture would be implied by goldbach 's strong conjecture , saying that he was certain that the theorem was true ( `` ein ganz gewisses theorema '' ) , but he was not unable to prove it . goldbach 's weak conjecture was later proved by harald helfgott in 2013 , but goldbach 's strong conjecture has not been proved yet . other websites . - `` goldbach 's conjecture '' , part of chris caldwell 's prime pages .
