Long March     the long march is the retreat of mao zedong and the communists in 1934-35. the communists went to their stronghold away from chiang kai-shek and the nationalists . here they were able to join together and start fighting again to beat the nationalists . they trekked 6,000 miles over 370 days , and only 8,000 survived out of 100,000 people . however , because they had survived such a difficult trial together the survivors were very dedicated and created a more cohesive group . mao zedong rose up as a leader during this time . the long march was over 12400 km , in one year . about 300,000 people started , and fewer than 10 % finished . they climbed some mountains more than 4000 meters high , before the long march , china had two sides : the nationalists and the communists . both sides wanted to rule the country . this brought the chinese civil war . chinese nationalists used 500,000 soldiers to remove the communists from jiang xi . they failed four times before . now the nationalists changed the way to attack the communists , using encirclement ( make a circle around the enemy army ) to stop them from running away . the communists leader borgu tried to fight 500,000 soldiers face to face . but the problem is that the jianxi communists just had 86,000 soldiers and more than half of them just had a broadsword and no guns . they failed to push the nationalist army back , so they tried to go to meet another communist army in shaanxi .
