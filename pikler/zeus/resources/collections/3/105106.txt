Sickle-cell disease     sickle cell anaemia is a genetic disease . it affects red blood cells . it changes the cells from flexible disks into rigid crescents . when many red cells take this shape veins get blocked . this can cause damage to many organs . the organ damage increases with time and leads to an early death . this is a lifelong disease which starts in childhood . the red blood cells take up an abnormal , rigid , sickle shape . the cells also become sticky . this causes difficult blood flow when cells flow through long narrow capillaries . low oxygen increases the problem . as they pass through low oxygen areas most cells take up this shape . the cells then stick to the inner wall of blood vessels , especially the branching point of veins . this leads to a blockade of blood flow in many organs . severe complications may result . the classic example of a sickle cell crisis is `` acute chest syndrome '' ( acs ) . this is unique to sicklers , and can cause death in a day or two unless treated . historically , acute chest syndrome was considered different from infection ( pneumonia ) . but in treatment there is not much point making that distinction .
