Computer architecture     in computer engineering , computer architecture is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system . it is the technical drawings and functional description of all design requirements ( especially speeds and interconnections ) , it is how to design and implement various parts of a computer â€” focusing largely on the way by which the central processing unit ( cpu ) operates internally and how it accesses addresses in memory . it can be defined as the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional , performance and cost goals . computer architecture includes at least three main subcategories : 1. instruction set architecture , or isa , is the abstract model of a computing system that is seen by a machine language ( or assembly language ) programmer , including the instruction set , memory address modes , processor registers , and address and data formats . 1. microarchitecture , also known as computer organization is a lower level , a detailed description of the system that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of all parts of the computing system , and how they are inter-connected and inter-operate in order to implement the isa . the size of a computer 's cache for instance , is an organizational issue that generally has nothing to do with the isa .
