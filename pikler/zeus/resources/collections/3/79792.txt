Mandrill     the mandrill ( `` mandrillus sphinx '' ) are the wold 's largest monkeys . they are also the most colourful primates . the skin colours brighten as the animal gets more excited . males live mostly on the forest floor , while females and young climb up into trees and bushes . males have an orange/yellow beard and an unmistakable bright red and blue snout and rump . females and juveniles have a duller blue snout and a buff beard . mandrills can live up to 40 years in captivity . they feed on fruits , leaves , roots , seeds , nuts , greens and invertebrates . mandrills live in cameroon , gabon and the congo . they live in dense rainforest and coastal forests , although they sometimes go onto the savannah . mandrills live on the ground and in trees . mandrills seem to live in large , stable groups called `` hordes '' . hordes often number in the hundreds , possibly averaging around 620 individuals and reaching as many as 845. it is difficult to accurately estimate group size in the forest , but filming a group crossing a gap between two forest patches or crossing a road is a reliable way of estimating group size . the largest group verifiably observed in this way contained over 1,300 individuals , in lopé national park , gabon—the largest aggregation of nonhuman primates ever recorded . these groups are made of adult females and their dependent offspring .
