Lanthanide     the lanthanide ( or lanthanoid ) series is a group of 15 elements that have atomic numbers 57 to 71. this group starts from lanthanum and it ends at lutetium . all lanthanoids are f-block elements , meaning that electrons fill the 4f electron shell , except for lutetium which is a d-block lanthanoid . the lanthanoid series ( ln ) is named after lanthanum . lanthanoids are metals that are related to each other in how they behave . most of them slowly turn into their hydroxides when they are placed into water , like the alkali metals . they usually form a coating of oxide when placed in the air , like most metals . lanthanides , with scandium and yttrium , are called rare earth elements .
