Black Knight     a black knight is a soldier or knight who either is not in service to a certain liege or does not want his liege , or himself , to be known and so does not have any heraldic standards or has painted them over with black paint . a good and well equipped soldier without a certain fealty is a wild card , or someone with the freedom to act who could be surprising . a group of them could be a big problem for kings . usually , a black knight is put in a bad light , as a soldier who has covered up his standards so it could not be found out where they came from . in made up stories , black knights are usually evil knights that are good at fighting and usually work alone . a good example of this would be the arthurian legend of the black knight .
