Rankine scale     the rankine scale is a thermodynamic ( absolute ) temperature scale . it is based around absolute zero . rankine is similar to the kelvin scale in that it starts at absolute zero and 0 '' °ra '' is the same as 0 '' k '' but is different as a change of 1 '' °ra '' is the same as a change of 1 '' °f '' ( fahrenheit ) and not 1 '' °c '' ( celsius ) . note that the abbreviation `` °r '' is ambiguous , as it can also refer to the réaumur scale . the kelvin and rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins ( k ) or 0 degrees rankine ( °r ) . the celsius and fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is −273.15 °c or −459.67 °f . the rankine scale was originally used in the united states .
