Accretion disc     an accretion disc ( or accretion disk ) is an astronomical term . it describes a disc of material being drawn in by gravity to a centre of mass , such as a star or black hole . as the material comes in , it spins round the central body and radiates energy . the central body is typically either a young star , a protostar , a white dwarf , a neutron star , or a black hole . as the material moves in , gravitational energy released in that process is transformed into heat and rotational movement . the energy emitted at the disk surface is in form of electromagnetic radiation . the frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object . accretion discs of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared , those around neutron stars and black holes in the x-ray part of the spectrum . other websites . - professor john f. hawley homepage - nonradiative black hole accretion - accretion discs on scholarpedia - magnetic fields snare black holes ' food - new scientist
