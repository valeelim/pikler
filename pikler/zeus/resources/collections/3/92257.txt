624 Hektor     624 hektor is the biggest of the jovian trojan asteroids . it was found in 1907 by august kopff . hektor is a d-type asteroid , dark and reddish in colour . it lies in jupiter 's leading lagrangian point , l , called the 'greek ' node after one of the two sides in the legendary trojan war . ironically , hektor is named after the trojan hero hektor , and is thus one of two trojan asteroids that is `` misplaced '' in the wrong camp ( the other being 617 patroclus in the trojan node ) . hektor is one of the most stretched bodies of its size in the solar system , being 370 Ã— 200 km . it is thought that hektor might be a contact binary ( two asteroids joined by gravitational attraction ) like 216 kleopatra . hubble space telescope sightings of hektor in 1993 did not show an obvious stretched shape because of a limited angular resolution . on july 17 , 2006 , the keck-10m ii telescope and its laser guide star adaptive optics ( ao ) system indicated a stretched shape for hektor . additionally , since this ao system provides an excellent and stable correction ( angular resolution of 0.060 arcsec in k band ) , a 15-km moon at 1000 km from hektor was found . the moon 's provisional designation is s/2006 ( 624 ) 1. hektor is , so far , the only known binary trojan asteroid in the l point and the first trojan with a moon . 617 patroclus , another big trojan asteroid in the l , is made of two same-sized asteroids .
