Runway     a runway ( also abbreviated to rwy ) is a strip of land on an airport , on which aircraft can take off and land . runways may be a man-made surface ( often asphalt , concrete , or a mixture of both ) or a natural surface ( grass , dirt , or gravel ) . sections of a runway . - the runway safety area is the cleared , smoothed and graded area around the paved runway . it is kept free from any obstacles that might impede flight or ground roll of aircraft . - the runway is the surface from threshold to threshold , which typically features threshold markings , numbers , centerlines , but not overrun areas at both ends . - blast pads , also known as overrun areas or stopways , are often constructed just before the start of a runway where jet blast produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway . overrun areas are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to slowly stop planes that overrun the runway on a landing gone wrong , or to slowly stop a plane on a rejected takeoff or a take-off gone wrong . blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are marked with yellow chevrons . planes are not allowed to taxi , take-off or land on blast pads , except in an emergency .
