World War I reparations     world war i reparations means the payments and transfers of property and equipment that germany was forced to make after its defeat during world war i. article 231 of the treaty of versailles ( the 'war guilt ' clause ) declared germany and its allies responsible for all 'loss and damage ' of the allies during the war and set up the basis for reparations . in january 1921 , the total sum due was decided by an inter-allied reparations commission and was set at 269 billion gold marks , about Â£23.6 billion or $ 32 billion ( roughly $ 393.6 billion us dollars as of 2005 ) . this was a sum that many economists believed to be too much . later that year , the amount was reduced to 132 billion marks , which still seemed too much for most german observers , both because of the amount itself as well as the terms . germany stopped paying the reparations after hitler 's nazi party took power in 1933. about one-eighth of the reparations paid by then . the final payments were made on the day exactly 20 years after german reunification .
