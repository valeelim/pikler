Van de Graaff Generator     a van de graaff generator is an electrostatic machine . it uses a moving belt to accumulate very high voltages on a hollow metal globe . the potential differences achieved in modern van de graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts . applications for these high voltage generators include driving x-ray tubes , accelerating electrons to sterilize food and process materials , and accelerating protons for nuclear physics experiments . the van de graaff generator can be thought of as a constant-current source connected in parallel with a capacitor and a very large electrical resistance . it is named after the american physicist robert jemison van de graaff , who built the first generators of this style in 1929 .
