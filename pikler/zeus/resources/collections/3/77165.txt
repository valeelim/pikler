Oceanic crust     oceanic crust is the part of earth 's lithosphere that is under the ocean basins . oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks , or sima . it is thinner than continental crust , or sial , generally less than 10 kilometers thick , however it is more dense , having a mean density of about 3.3 g/cm . oceanic crust generally does not last longer than 200 million years . it is continuously being created at oceanic ridges . at these ridges , hot magma rises into the crust and cools , pushing the crust apart at the ridge . the continuous formation of new oceanic crust pushes the older crust away from the mid-ocean ridge . as it moves away from the ridge , the crust becomes cooler and denser , while the sediment may build on top of it . related pages . - continental crust sources . - marshak , stephen .
