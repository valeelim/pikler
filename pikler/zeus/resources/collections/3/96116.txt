Pectus excavatum     pectus excavatum is a congenital medical condition where the ribs and sternum grow abnormally , producing a sunken appearance to the chest . this makes the chest look like it has caved in on itself . it is also commonly refereed to as `` funnel chest '' or `` chest bowl '' . it is the most common form of pectus deformity , occurring in approximately 1 in 300-400 births , with a 3:1 male predominance ratio . whilst pectus excavatum occurs at birth , it often does not develop properly until early adolescence when growth is more rapid . doctors do not know why some people have the dent . they think it might be caused by a bad gene from the parent . it is also linked to syndromes ( illnesses ) that effect other parts of the body . pectus excavatum happens in about 1 in every 300-400 children with the majority of cases being male . a vacuum bell , also called a suction cup , can be used to fix pectus excavatum . the cup is placed on the chest and all the air is removed : this pulls up the chest . this non-invasive procedure shows promise to be a permanent cure for pectus excavatum . treatment must continue for two years after the appearance of correction is made .
