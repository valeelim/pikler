10 Hygiea     10 hygiea is the fourth biggest object in the asteroid belt . it is somewhat non-spherical in shape , with diameters of 350 â€“ 500 km . its mass is estimated to be 3 % of the total mass of the asteroid belt . it is the biggest of the class of dark c-type asteroids with a carbonaceous surface that are dominant in the farther part main belt , which lies beyond the kirkwood gap at 2.82 au , and is also the biggest body in this region . its dark surface and bigger than average distance from the sun makes it very dim for such a big asteroid when seen from earth . in fact it is the third dimmest of the first twenty-three asteroids discovered , with only 13 egeria and the quite small 17 thetis having lower mean opposition magnitudes . at most oppositions , hygiea has a magnitude of around +10.2 , which is as much as four orders fainter than vesta , and will need at least a 4-inch telescope to resolve . at a perihelic opposition , however , hygiea can reach +9.1 and may just be resolvable with 10x50 binoculars , unlike the fifth and sixth biggest asteroids 704 interamnia and 511 davida which are always beyond binocular visibility .
