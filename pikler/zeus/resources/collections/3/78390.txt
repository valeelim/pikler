Gaelic Games     gaelic games are the traditional sports played in ireland . the two main gaelic games are gaelic football and hurling . both are organised by the gaelic athletic association ( gaa ) . other games organised by the association include camogie , rounders , gaelic handball . during the late 19th century , gaelic games in ireland were dying out . this decline was stopped by the gaa and the irish national gaelic revival . today they are the most popular games in ireland . gaelic football is the most popular of the gaelic games and is played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with h-shaped goals at each end . the object is to score by driving the ball through the goals . the team with the highest score at the end of the match wins . it combines the skills of soccer and basketball in a fast-paced , high-scoring contact sport . a slightly different rule set is used for women 's gaelic football ( officially called `` ladies ' gaelic football '' ) . the women 's game also uses 15-player teams and h-shaped goals , but allows less physical contact .
