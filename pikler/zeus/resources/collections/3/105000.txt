Edo     the site of the city , on what is now known as tokyo bay , had been settled for several centuries , but first became historically significant with the building of edo castle in 1457 by order of ōta dōkan . kyoto was the site of the japanese emperor 's residence and the capital of japan for many centuries , until the tokugawa shogunate was established in 1603 and edo became its seat of government . from that point kyoto remained merely the formal capital of the country , while the `` de facto '' capital was now edo , the center of real political power . edo consequently rapidly grew from what had been a small , virtually unknown fishing village in 1457 to a big city of 1,000,000 residents by 1721 , the largest city in the world at the time . in 1868 , when the shogunate came to an end , the city was renamed `` tokyo '' , meaning `` eastern capital '' , and the emperor moved his residence to tokyo , making the city the formal capital of japan . related pages . - edo period references . - alternate spelling from 1911 `` encyclopædia britannica '' article
