Tangent (geometry)    tangent ( geometry ) in geometry , a tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at one point . at the place where they touch , the line and the curve both have the same slope ( they are both `` going in the same direction '' ) . for this reason , a tangent line is a good approximation of the curve near that point . the curve and the tangent line are almost exactly the same near the intersection point . a straight line which touches a circle at a single point is perpendicular to the circle 's radius and is considered tangent to the circle . tangent lines are useful in calculus because they can magnify the slope of a curve at a single point . the slope of some curve at the point p is often called the instantaneous rate of change of the curve at p. the instantaneous rate of change at a specific point on the curve can be found by evaluating the derivative function for the curve at that point . related pages . - derivative ( mathematics ) - calculus - trigonometric function
