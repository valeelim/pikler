Antiderivative     antidifferentiation ( also called indefinite integration ) is a part of mathematics . it is the opposite of differentiation . antidifferentiation is integration with no limits ( which is why it is called indefinite ) . the answer to an antiderivative is an equation . it is written as formula_1 - with the integral sign that has no limits formula_2 - the equation you are integrating formula_3 - and the formula_4 which means `` with respect to formula_3 '' , which does not mean anything with simple integration . to integrate formula_6 - add 1 to the power formula_7 , so formula_6 is now formula_9 - divide all this by the new power , so it is now formula_10 - add constant formula_11 , so it is now formula_12 this can be shown as : formula_13 when there are many formula_3 terms , integrate each part on its own : formula_15 changing fractions and roots into powers makes it easier : if you want to integrate a bracket like formula_21 , we need to do it a different way . it is called the chain rule . it is like simple integration . it only works if the formula_3 in the bracket has a power of 1 ( it is linear ) like formula_3 or formula_24 ( not formula_25 or formula_26 ) .
