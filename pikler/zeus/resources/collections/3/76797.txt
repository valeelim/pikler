Saxe-Hildburghausen     saxe-hildburghausen was one of the ernestine duchies of the house of wettin . although it was very small , saxe-hildburghausen was an independent duchy from 1680 to 1826. in 1684 the duchy changed its capital from heldburg to hildburghausen , and changed its name to saxe-hildburghausen . in 1810 , a princess therese of saxe-hildburghausen married crown prince ludwig of bavaria , who became king of bavaria 15 years later . the marriage is the reason for the oktoberfest , held annually in munich . in 1826 , the ernestine duchies were reorganised after the last ruler of saxe-gotha-altenburg died without an heir . the duke of saxe-hildburghausen gave up his duchy in return for becoming duke of saxe-altenburg . hildburghausen was given to saxe-meiningen . hildburghausen was not one of the duchies in the imperial circle , altenburg was , so by swapping his land the duke gained in social rank , even though the holy roman empire no longer existed in 1868 , four districts were established in the duchy of saxe-meiningen . hildburghausen was one of these districts , with boundaries very similar to those of the former duchy . it remained almost unchanged until 1993 , when the former district of suhl was dissolved and most of its municipalities joined the district .
