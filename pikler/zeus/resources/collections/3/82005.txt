Wozzeck     wozzeck is an opera by the austrian composer alban berg ( 1885-1935 ) . it was composed between 1914 and 1922 and first performed in 1925. berg wrote this opera before the period when he used serialism in his works . his teacher schoenberg had not yet developed the twelve tone system . the music of `` wozzeck '' has tonal music in the tradition of mahler , but also some atonal music ( music which is not based on any key ) as well as melodies which are based on the whole tone scale . the music sounded very modern at the time it was written . berg also writes for the voices in unusual ways : sometimes they have to half-speak , half-sing ( this is called sprechgesang ) . the opera is based on a play called `` woyzeck '' by the german playwright georg b√ºchner . `` woyzeck '' was an unusual drama because , instead of being a story about someone important such as a king or a god , it was about a poor man who is not very smart and is bullied and misused by other people . when berg wrote the opera nearly a century later , it was still an unusual story for an opera . the heroes in operas were usually important people , while working people often had comic parts : they were often servants . but wozzeck is a simple man who can not help what is happening to him . in drama this is sometimes called an `` anti-hero '' .
