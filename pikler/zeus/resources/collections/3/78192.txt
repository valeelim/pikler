Shalom     shalom ( שלום ) is a hebraic word which means `` peace '' . like in english , it can mean the peace between two parts , as well as an inner peace , being calm or the quietness of a person . it is also used as a method of greeting like `` hello '' , `` good day ( morning , afternoon , high noon ... ) '' or `` good bye '' . the root of the word `` shalom '' can be related to `` le-shalem '' which means `` to complete , to reward , to pay , to compensate '' . this means that it is more than the absence of conflict or struggle or the breaking of unfriendliness : it also means a return to the balance , to justice , and to the complete equality . in general , one uses the word `` shalom '' as the short form of the sentence `` shalom aleichem '' ( exactly `` peace is with you '' ) that can be translated as `` good day ( morning , afternoon , high noon ... ) '' ( a greeting ) . this is very similar to the arabic phrase `` salam alaykum '' ( سلام عليكم ) which is again a greeting meaning `` peace be with you '' .
