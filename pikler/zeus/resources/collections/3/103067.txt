Locomotive     a locomotive is the part of a train that makes the train move . normally , it is the first part of the train , and has an engine . a diesel locomotive is a powered by a diesel engine . the diesel engine may drive the locomotive 's wheels directly via a gearbox , shaft or chain ( called mechanical transmission ) ; by generating electricity which is in turn used to power the wheels ( called diesel-electric ) ; or by using a hydraulic transmission system ( diesel-hydraulic ) . diesel locomotives are extremely popular worldwide , due to their ease of use and reliability . they are more powerful than steam locomotives and do not need an expensive power grid like electric locomotives . a steam locomotive uses wood , coal or oil ( but mostly coal ) as fuel to heat water in a boiler , which turns into steam which pushes pistons to power the train . steam locomotives were invented in the early 19th century . they are not widely used any more due to their operational costs , especially the fuel costs ; steam locomotives are now mostly only used on tourist railroads .
