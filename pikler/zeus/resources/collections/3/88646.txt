Epithelium     epithelium ( plural : epithelia ) is one of the four main types of tissue in the body of animals . it is made up of one or more layers of cells . the outermost layer of the skin is a special type of epithelium . it has an important function : it forms a mechanical defence against infection : see innate immunity . epithelia are found on the surface of organs and many other parts of the body . one main function of epithelia is moving fluids into or out of an organ or body part . it also protects organs and carries sense organs . there are many different types of epithelium that do different things in the body , including the excretory system . the epithelium covers blood vessels and hollow organs such as the stomach and kidneys . all glands are made from epithelial cells . in some areas , the epithelium secretes sweat , oil , or mucus . functions of epithelial cells include secretion , selective absorption , protection , transcellular transport , and sensing . epithelial layers have no blood vessels : they get oxygen and nourishment from the underlying connective tissue , through the basement membrane .
