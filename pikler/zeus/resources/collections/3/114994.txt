Bose-Einstein statistics     in statistical mechanics , bose-einstein statistics means the statistics of a system where you can not tell the difference between any of the particles , and the particles are bosons . bosons are fundamental particles like the photon . the bose-einstein distribution tells you how many particles have a certain energy . the formula is with formula_2 and where : if formula_3 , then the maxwellâ€“boltzmann statistics is a good approximation .
