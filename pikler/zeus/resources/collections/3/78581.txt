Queen's Counsel    queen 's counsel queen 's counsel ( postnominal qc ) , during the reign of a male sovereign known as king 's counsel ( kc ) , are senior lawyers in various commonwealth countries . they are appointed by letters patent to be one of `` her majesty 's counsel learned in the law '' . they are not a separate type of lawyer . they are more than long serving lawyers , because their status is given by the crown and recognised by the courts . queen 's counsel have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court , and wear silk gowns of a special design ( hence the informal title silks ) . the special robes are the reason why becoming a qc is often called `` taking silk '' . in order to `` take silk '' a lawyer usually has to serve as a barrister or a scottish advocate for at least 10 years . recently solicitors have also been appointed queen 's counsel . a qc 's status means they generally charge higher fees than ordinary barristers , and always have another barrister as an assistant . this assistant is called a `` junior '' even if the junior has been a lawyer longer than the `` silk '' .
