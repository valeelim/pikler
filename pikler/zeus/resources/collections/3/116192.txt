Conference USA     conference usa , officially abbreviated c-usa , is a group of college sports teams that play each other on the ncaa division i level . it was formed in 1995 when the great midwest conference and metro conference merged , and has added several members since then . most of the new members have come from either the western athletic conference or the sun belt conference . from 2005 to 2014 , it also lost many members , mostly to the original big east conference and its football-playing offshoot , the american athletic conference . the conference sends several teams to bowl games every year , including the liberty bowl and new orleans bowl . memphis ( now a member of the american ) has been the most successful men 's basketball team in the conference , reaching the national championship game in 2008 . ( however , the ncaa later took memphis 's wins from that season away because a memphis player , namely derrick rose , had not been eligible to play . ) conference usa now has 14 `` full members '' which play most of their sports in the league ; all except rice are public schools . also , 13 of the 14 schools play football in the top-level division i fbs . the one non-football member , charlotte , only started playing football in 2013 , and will join the c-usa football league in 2015 .
