Dive bomber     a dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives towards the ground so it can get very close to its targets so that it is more likely to hit them . this can also limit the chance of anti-aircraft fire hitting the plane . diving nearly vertically at the target , the aircraft will release the bombs very close to the target at high speed . this allows a dive bomber to drop bombs accurately on a relatively small target , or a moving target quite easily . dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges . this also had the advantage of attacking ships at a weak spot . a ship 's armour was heaviest near the water . on the top of the ship , however , the armour was very thin , or there was no armour at all . also , dive bombing allowed relatively small aeroplanes carrying a limited bomb load to do more damage than usual . because of better bombsights and better anti-aircraft warfare after world war ii , dive bombers were replaced by attack aircraft .
