Substitution cipher     a substitution cipher is a form of cryptography . in a substitution cipher , a rule is used to change each letter of the message , one at a time . the rule says to replace ( or `` substitute '' ) each letter with another letter from the alphabet . for instance , this table gives a rule for a substitution cipher : using this rule , the sentence `` jack and jill went up the hill '' is changed to `` etar tzn evmm gkzc dw cuk uvmm '' . the caesar cipher is one example of a substitution cipher . substitution ciphers are not safe enough to use for important messages . substitution ciphers can be broken by an idea called `` frequency analysis '' . some letters are more common than others in english sentences : `` e '' is the most common , then `` t '' , then `` a '' , and so on . a message that has been changed by a substitution cipher will have different common letters , but this gives a hint about the rule . the most common letters in the changed message are likely to be the most common letters in english . breaking `` cryptograms '' ( messages hidden with a substitution cipher ) is a common puzzle often found in newspapers .
