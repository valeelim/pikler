Ceasefire     a ceasefire ( or truce ) is a stoppage of a war or any armed conflict , where each side of the conflict agrees with the other to stop aggressive actions for some time . ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal treaty , but they have also been called part of an informal understanding between opposing forces . on december 24 , 1914 , during world war i , there was an unofficial ceasefire as both the germans and the british sought to observe christmas ( the `` christmas truce '' ) . there was no treaty signed , and after a few days the war resumed . a ceasefire was reached on july 27 , 1953 to halt the conflict of the korean war and establish a demilitarized zone . but no peace treaty has been signed . therefore , officially north and south korea are still at war . pakistan 's government has repeatedly claimed that the republic of india is violating the simla agreement by constructing a fence along the cesefire line in the kashmir conflict . however , the government of india maintains the fence has decreased armed infiltration into indian-administered kashmir .
