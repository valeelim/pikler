American Lacrosse Conference     the american lacrosse conference ( alc ) was a group of colleges and universities in the eastern half of the united states that played ncaa division i women 's lacrosse against one another each season . women 's lacrosse was the only sport that this conference ever playedâ€”all members were ( and still are ) in other conferences for other sports . the conference champion earned a spot in the ncaa division i women 's lacrosse tournament . the alc was founded in 2001 by seven schools , with play starting in 2002. nine schools were members at one time or another , but no more than seven played in any season . the conference folded after the 2014 season , mainly because the big ten conference , home to four of the alc 's final seven members , planned to start a women 's lacrosse league in the 2015 season . nine schools were members of the alc during its history . note that because ncaa women 's lacrosse is a spring sport , the year of joining is the year before the first season of play .
