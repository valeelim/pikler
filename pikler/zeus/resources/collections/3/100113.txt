Epistle to the Hebrews     the epistle to the hebrews or letter to the hebrews is one of the letters of the new testament . although it is believed by many to be written by the apostle paul , many others think it might have been written by one group of early christians to a general group of jews ( also called hebrews ) , or to a church with jewish members . the letter explains that jesus christ , the son of god , is the perfect sacrifice for human sinners . he is superior to angels and is our high priest in the order of melchizedek . jesus is the messiah whose coming gives us the superior new covenant , as compared to the old covenant of abraham and moses . the writers state that if the old covenant was faultless , god would not have sent his son to start a new one . by stating that people are called righteous through their faith and belief in god 's ways , the writers urge the readers to receive god 's grace by accepting jesus christ .
