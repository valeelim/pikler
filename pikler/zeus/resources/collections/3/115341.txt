PAL     pal ( short for phase alternating line ) is a method to encode color in analogue television broadcasting systems . it is one of three standards in wide use today . the other two are secam and ntsc . european countries wanted to introduce colour television in the 1950s . they had a few problems though . ntsc is used in america . american electricity supply uses 60 hz ac , but europe uses 50 hz . tv studios ' lightbulbs change brightness at twice the supply frequency . if the tv picture rate is not the same as the grid frequency , then a dark bar can be seen on the tv . the bar moves up or down the tv screen . this is due to the stroboscope effect , which also makes car wheels appear to turn the wrong way on tv . ntsc has some weaknesses . the most important weakness of ntsc was that colour tones would change if transmission conditions were bad . for these reasons the development of the secam and pal standards began . the goal was to make a colour tv standard with a picture frequency of 50 fields per second ( 50 hertz ) , and a better colour picture than ntsc .
