Bean machine     the bean machine , also known as the quincunx or galton box , is a machine invented by sir francis galton to demonstrate the law of error and the normal distribution . the machine consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins . balls are dropped from the top , and bounce left and right as they hit the pins . eventually , they are collected into one-ball-wide bins at the bottom . the height of ball columns in the bins approximates a bell curve . overlaying pascal 's triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each pin . a large-scale working model of this device can be seen at the museum of science , boston .
