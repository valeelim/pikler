High fidelity     high fidelity or hi-fi is a way of describing a very good home music system . `` high fidelity '' means that the sound is as close to the original as possible with no changes or added noise . people who like hi-fi are sometimes called audiophiles . hi-fi is often now called `` high-end audio '' . in the 1930s and 1940s , vacuum tubes were used to make radios and electronic amplifiers . radio was becoming popular , and microphones , amplifiers and loudspeakers began to be sold . manufacturers began to compete to produce the best product . a lot of research was done at bell laboratories and products were made by western electric . then a new kind of vinyl record with less noise and better sound was invented . manufacturers began to call their equipment and records `` high fidelity '' to help sell them . in the 1950s , `` hi-fi '' became the popular term , replacing `` phonograph '' and `` record player '' . rather than playing a record `` on the phonograph , '' people would play it `` on the hi-fi '' . in the late 1950s and early 1960s , westrex invented the stereo record that used two speakers . this led to more improvements in home audio . the word `` stereo '' replaced the word `` hi-fi . '' records were now played on `` a stereo '' .
