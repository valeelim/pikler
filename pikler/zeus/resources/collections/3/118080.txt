Saul     saul ( ; or sha'ul ; ) is a king in the books of samuel , 1 chronicles and the qur'an . he was the first king of the ancient israel . he reigned from 1047 bc to 1007 bc . in the bible , saul loves and obeys god , until he stops listening to god and becomes slightly greedy , losing god 's whole interest for him . samuel , the prophet , comes and gives him a warning that god is not with him anymore . when turning to leave , saul grabs samuel 's robe , and it tears . samuel says ( 1samuel15:28~29 ) , `` the lord has torn the kingdom of israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors - to one better than you . he who is the glory of israel does not lie or change his mind ; for he is not a man , that he should change his mind . '' then the spirit of the lord departs from saul , and an evil spirit torments him . saul takes david the shepherd , and the youngest son of jesse , into his service to play a harp for him and so that he would be soothed when the evil spirit rests upon him . later he gets jealous of david , and begins to suspect david as the 'one of your neighbors ' that samuel had mentioned . he grows afraid of david , and finally his jealousy turns to hatred , and he wishes to kill him . but saul 's son jonathan is bound to david in friendship , which makes his anger fume on jonathan as well .
