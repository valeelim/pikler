Cambrian     the cambrian is the first geological period of the palaeozoic era . it lasted from 541 million years ago to 485.4 million years ago . before it came the ediacaran , and after it the ordovician . biologists have learnt quite a lot about the soft parts of cambrian animals . this is because places have been found where soft parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells . this means our understanding of the cambrian biota is better than that of some later periods . life on earth changed greatly during the cambrian period . before the cambrian , life was mostly small and simple . complex organisms ( metazoa ) evolved during the proterozoic era . but during the cambrian period , some organisms used carbonate minerals for shells , so they had hard parts which could become fossils . there were many different kinds of life during the cambrian period . this diversification of lifeforms was relatively rapid , and is called the cambrian explosion . this adaptive radiation produced the first members of the main groups of animals , called phyla .
