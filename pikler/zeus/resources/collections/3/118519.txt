Freemasonry     freemasonry is an organization of people who believe in brotherhood and helping others . its members are known as `` freemasons '' ( in full : `` ancient free and accepted masons '' , or simply `` masons '' ) . freemasons also help one another in times of hardship . freemasonry can be found all over the world in various forms . about 6 million people are freemasons . the local groups in various countries are known as `` lodges '' . at the state or national level are `` grand lodges '' . these are independent of each other . `` regular '' freemasonry is only for men , but there are also co-ed masonic lodges ( and lodges for only women ) that are not recognized as legitimate by the `` regular '' groups . all of these lodges believe in `` brotherly love , relief and truth '' . they do work for charities such as running schools for orphaned children . there is a royal masonic hospital which is a home for old members and their families . the word mason means a construction worker who works with stone . he is also called a `` stonemason '' . freemasonry grew from the groups ( guilds ) of stonemasons in the middle ages . these men were building cathedrals and other big buildings . they were called freemasons because they were free , they were not servants who belonged to a rich lord , like many workers were in those days . they often changed jobs and moved about from one town to another . in this way they were different from other craftsmen who often worked in one place and had guilds in one town . the stonemasons tried to keep their skills secret so that only they knew how to do their job . this is probably why the freemasons have hand shakes and passwords that they swear to keep secret .
