Subspecies     subspecies is a classification ( taxonomy ) in biology . it is directly below species . when looking at the latin name , subspecies are indicated by the third name . subspecies can mix with each other ; animals or plants from different subspecies can have offspring together ( this is usually not the case with animals from different species ) . when looking at subspecies , they can also be told apart sufficiently by looking at the appearance or dna of an animal or plant . very often , there are populations that are between two subspecies ; this is because evolution is a continuous process . subspecies can often be recognised by `` subsp '' or `` ssp '' ( before the third part of the name ) especially in botany . examples of subspecies are : - the dog ( `` canis lupus familiaris '' ) and the dingo ( `` canis lupus dingo '' ) are both subspecies of the wolf ( `` canis lupus '' ) - the domestic cat ( `` felis silvestris catus '' ) is a subspecies of the wild cat ( `` felis silvestris '' ) in zoology , when a species is split into subspecies , the first described population is known as the `` nominate subspecies '' , and it repeats the same name as the species . for example , the `` daboia russelii russelii '' ( known as the indian russell 's viper ) is a nominate subspecies of the species `` daboia russelii '' ( known as the russell 's viper ) .
