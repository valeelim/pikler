Laws of Form     laws of form is a book by george spencer-brown published in 1969. it is about logic , mathematics , and philosophy . the mathematical systems that spencer-brown presented in the book are known by the names `` calculus of indications '' , `` distinction calculus '' , and often just `` lof '' . `` laws of form '' grew out of the author 's work in electronic engineering . the book has been published in several editions and translations and has never gone out of print . a short book , its mathematical part is only 55 pages long . spencer-brown 's philosophy was influenced by ludwig wittgenstein , r.d . laing , charles sanders peirce , bertrand russell , and alfred north whitehead . `` laws of form '' was listed in the `` whole earth catalog '' in 1969 and quickly became a cult classic . the calculus of indications and the primary algebra may be regarded as a way to think about a fundamental activity of the mind , namely , the ability to `` distinguish '' or to `` draw distinctions '' . the book argues that this ability is the foundation of human cognition and consciousness . according to spencer-brown , the primary arithemetic and primary algebra reveal new connections among logic , mathematics , the philosophy of language , and the philosophy of mind .
