Erinaceidae     erinaceidae is a family in the mammalian order eulipotyphla . it contains the well-known hedgehogs of eurasia and africa and the moonrats of south-east asia . this family was once in the order insectivora , but that order is not used anymore . erinaceids are generally shrew-like in form , with long snouts and short tails , but they are much larger than shrews . all but one species have five toes in each foot ( in some cases with strong claws for digging ) and they have large eyes and ears . hedgehogs have hair modified into sharp spines to form a protective covering over the upper body and flanks , while gymnures have only normal hair . most species have anal scent glands , but these are far better developed in gymnures , which can have a powerful odor . erinaceids are omnivorous , with the major part of their diet consisting of insects , earthworms , and other small invertebrates . they also eat seeds and fruit , and occasionally bird 's eggs , along with any carrion they come across . their teeth are sharp and suited for impaling invertebrate prey . the dental formula for erinaceids is : upper=2-3.1.4.3 ; lower=3.1.2-4.3 .
