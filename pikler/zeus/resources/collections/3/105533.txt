Gili Islands     the gili islands ( indonesian : tiga gili [ three gilis ] , kepulauan gili [ gili islands ] ) are an archipelago of three small islands – gili trawangan , gili meno and gili air — just off the northwest coast of lombok , indonesia . the islands are a popular destination for western tourists looking for a remote island experience . each island has several small resorts , usually consisting of a small collection of huts for tourists , and a restaurant . most local inhabitants live in the hilly interior of the island . automobiles and motorized traffic are prohibited on the islands by local ordinance , so the preferred method of transportation is bicycle or the horse-drawn carriage called a `` cidomo '' . diving in and around the gilis is also popular , although the prices are fairly high due to local cartel activities . the name `` gili islands '' is a bit of a misnomer , because `` gili '' simply means `` small island '' in sasak .
