Electric eel     the electric eel , `` electrophorus electricus '' , is a species of fish . it can weigh up to six pounds . it can give electric shocks of up to six hundred fifty watts of electricity . the animal uses these shocks both for hunting and to defend itself . it lives in the stagnant muddy river bottoms of the orinoco and the amazon , and uses low-voltage electric fields to find its prey . the electric eel is an apex predator in the parts of south america where it lives . this means it usually has no enemies except other animals of its own species . it can kill animals larger than itself . its electric organs evolved from muscles , and make up four fifths of its body . despite its name , the electric eel is not an eel . it is a knifefish . it is an obligatory air breather ( must breath air ) . this makes sense , because the muddy water is very low in oxygen , and it needs oxygen to power its electric organs . because they can shock , very few of these fish are kept as pets . but if the eel repeatedly shocks , its electric organs become completely discharged . then a person can touch it without being shocked .
