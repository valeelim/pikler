Blog     blog is another word for weblog . a weblog is a website that is like a diary or journal . most people can create a blog and then write on that blog . bloggers ( a word for people who write on blogs ) often write about their opinions and thoughts . a blog containing video material is called a video blog or video log , usually shortened to vlog . when a person writes on a blog , what they write is in the form of a `` post '' , which is a single piece of writing on the blog . posts often include links to other websites . blogs can have one or more writers . if they have more than one writer , they are often called community blogs , team blogs , or group blogs . on many blogs , the person reading the posts can leave comments , which are notes in which a person says what they think about the blog post . this makes blogs good for discussion â€” if someone writes something that someone else does not believe to be true , someone else can fix it by writing a comment on that blog or on their own blog . someone else can not change what the post says , but the writer of the post can . not all blog posts need to be talked about or fixed . but if there are a lot of people interested in a topic , they can start a discussion on the original blog , on their own blogs , or both . these people can discuss a topic or their point of view .
