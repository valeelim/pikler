ENIAC     eniac ( which meant `` electronic numerical integrator and computer '' ) was a computer built between 1943 and 1946. it was designed by two people called john mauchly and j. presper eckert . the machine was built out of nearly 17,500 vacuum tubes , 7,200 diodes and many miles of wire . it took up of space , which is the size of a large room . even though another digital computer , called the abc ( atanasoff-berry computer ) , was made first in 1937 , the eniac is still considered to be the first computer . this is because the abc was not programmable . because the computer was built out of vacuum tubes , it often broke . this meant that someone had to find the failed tube ( which was `` not '' an easy job ) , take the bad tube out and put a working tube in . making programs for the computer was difficult . making the computer ready for one single program could take many days or even weeks . this was because the programming had to be done by pulling wires from one place to another . this was not hard for small programs , but if a large program was wanted , it was very hard work . programming by pulling wires was used until 1948 , when a special type of memory was added ( called read only memory ( rom ) , because the computer could read it but not write it ) . after that , programming was done by using switches , which only took hours instead of days .
