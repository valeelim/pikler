Co-evolution     co-evolution is where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of one or more other species . species whose lives connect , evolve together . what happens is that survival rates in each species changes as a result of changes in the other species . examples of co-evolution are : - species which mutually benefit - flowers and the animals that pollinate them - life-forms in a symbiosis - species which are antagonistic - predators and their prey - parasites and their hosts co-evolution is extremely common , and may involve more than two species . mimicry rings , with dozens of species , are known . new or 'improved ' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of related features in the other species . the study of co-evolution dates back to darwin 's `` on the origin of species '' . there he discussed how cats increased heather by reducing mice . the point being that mice raid bumblebee nests and bumblebees pollinate red heather . so more cats cause more heather . in the last paragraph of the origin darwin remarks :
