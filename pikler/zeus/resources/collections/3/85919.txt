SCSI     scsi is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices , such as a hard drive or cd or dvd drive . scsi stands for small computer system interface , although the `` small '' is historic ; scsi is used on both large and small computers . scsi is usually pronounced as `` scuzzy '' . few peripherals ( other than hard drives and tape drives ) were made after the 20th century . later ones used usb or in some cases firewire . scsi is realized by a bus slot on the motherboard . just to put a card called host adapter to the motherboard . from this card is a managed data cable . this cable connects individual scsi peripherals . each of this peripherals has its own sequencer which is functional independent . operation on data cable ( bus scsi ) is controlled by the host adapter . this makes it possible to install internal or external components . transferring data on the scsi bus is managed by the host adapter . the cpu is not loaded by transferring data . each peripheral has its own sequencer and host adapter . they can be used for communication with devices by a defined `` computer '' language . they could also cooperate with arbitrary peripherals of scsi . at present there are hard disks , optical drives , tape adapter units , zip drives , scanners and printers using scsi .
