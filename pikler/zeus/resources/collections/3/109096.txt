Alkene     in organic chemistry , an alkene , olefin , or olefine is an unsaturated chemical compound containing at least one carbon-to-carbon double bond . the simplest alkenes , with only one double bond , no rings , and no other functional groups , are hydrocarbons with the general formula ch . aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes , but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes . the double bond in the middle makes them more reactive because the molecule is not saturated . an alkene 's unsaturation means that it will take the color out of bromine . the names of alkenes always end with -ene . the following is a list of the first sixteen alkenes : - ethene ( ch ) - propene ( ch ) - butene ( ch ) - pentene ( ch ) - hexene ( ch ) - heptene ( ch ) - octene ( ch ) - nonene ( ch ) - decene ( ch ) - undecene ( ch ) - dodecene ( ch ) - tridecene ( ch ) - tetradecene ( ch ) - pentadecene ( ch ) - hexadecene ( ch ) the physical properties of alkenes are comparable with those of alkanes . the main differences between the two are that the acidity levels of alkenes are much higher than the ones in alkanes . the physical state depends on molecular mass ( gases from ethene to butene - liquids from pentene onwards ) . the simplest alkenes , ethene , propene and butene are gases . linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids , and higher alkenes are waxy solids .
