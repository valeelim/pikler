Mab (moon)    mab ( moon ) mab is a closer moon to uranus . it was found by mark r. showalter and jack j. lissauer in 2003 using the hubble space telescope . it was named after queen mab , a fairy queen from english folklore who is mentioned in william shakespeare 's play `` romeo and juliet '' . because the moon is small and dark , it was not seen in the images taken by `` voyager 2 '' during its uranus flyby in 1986. however , it is brighter than another moon , perdita , which was discovered from voyager 's photos in 1997. this led scientists to look at the old photos again , and the moon was finally found in the images . if it is as dark as puck , it is about 24 km in diameter . on the other hand , if it is brightly coloured like the neighbouring moon miranda , it would be even smaller than cupid and comparable to the smallest farther moons . mab is heavily perturbed , meaning its movement is not only caused by the gravity of another large thing . the actual source for perturbation is still unclear , but is probably one or more of the nearby orbiting moons .
