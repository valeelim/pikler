Keyboard (computer)    keyboard ( computer ) a computer keyboard is an input device that allows a person to enter letters , numbers , and other symbols ( these are called characters ) into a computer . it is one of the most used input devices for computers . using a keyboard to enter lots of data is called typing . a keyboard contains many mechanical switches or push-buttons called `` keys '' . when one of these are pushed , an electrical circuit is closed , and the keyboard sends a signal to the computer that tells it what letter , number or symbol it would like to be shown on the screen . the computer 's cpu then shows the character on the screen , usually at the place where the cursor is . besides entering characters , computer keyboards also have keys that change the symbol ( such as shift or caps lock ) or give the computer special commands ( such as the arrow keys , ctrl and alt ) . these keys depend on the operating system which the keyboard is being used on . a keyboard can be joined to a computer using a wire , but can also be wireless ( like those that use bluetooth ) . today , most keyboards that use wires connect to a usb port on the computer , but older ones use a type of port called ps/2 , which is slower than usb .
