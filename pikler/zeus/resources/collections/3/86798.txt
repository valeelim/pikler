Egyptian pyramids     the pyramids of egypt are among the largest structures ever built and are one of the most important examples of ancient egyptian civilization . most were built during the old and middle kingdom periods . when the pyramid was almost finished , casing blocks of white limestone were laid on top of the main pyramid blocks . each casing block was then trimmed so that the outer surface of the pyramid would be smooth and white . some capstones were covered with metal leaf . the casing blocks from the great pyramid of giza were all removed in the 14th and 15th centuries a.d. and used to build the city of cairo . some casing blocks still remain on the top of the pyramid next to khufu 's ( belonging to khafra ) . the ancient egyptians built pyramids as tombs for the pharaohs and their queens . the pharaohs were buried in pyramids of different sizes from before the beginning of the old kingdom to the end of the middle kingdom . three small pyramids were built on the eastern side of the great pyramid . these pyramids were built for khufu 's queens .
