Ghetto     'ghetto ' has two possible sources : - `` getto '' , the venetian word for foundry slag , because the jews were only allowed on the same island where the iron foundries were . - others believe it is from the italian word `` borghetto '' , meaning a little `` borgo '' or ‘ borough ’ . originally the word `` ghetto '' meant the jewish quarter of venice , and later of any european town . the term `` ghetto '' is now commonly used to refer to any poverty-stricken urban area with a concentration of minority groups . it is also used to refer to areas that are considered to be undesirable . a ghetto was also the name given to the area jewish people were first kept in in the holocaust .
