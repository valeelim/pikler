Soil science     soil science deals with soil as a natural resource on the surface of the earth . it includes soil formation , classification and mapping . but many more sciences deal with knowledge of soils and the advancement of the soil sciences : engineering , agronomists , chemistry , geology , geography , biology , microbiology , sylviculture , public health , archaeology , and regional planning . `` soil '' refers to anything between the top of the dirt and the top of the underlying rock ( called `` bedrock '' ) . soil is often broken into layers . the top layer is high in organic matter ( roting plants and such ) . then there is a layer of layer of soil where rain water has removed some metals ( called `` leaching '' ) . those metals get collected in another , lower layer . finally , there is a layer made up mostly of broken bits of bedrock . a soil can have all of these layers , or only a few . soils are important because most groundwater , which is used in everything from city water supplies to farming , is found in soil , not bedrock .
