Horseradish     horseradish ( `` armoracia rusticana '' ) is a perennial plant of the brassicaceae family . the plant is probably native to southeastern europe and western asia . it grows up to 1.5 metres ( 5 feet ) tall , and is cultivated primarily for its large , white , tapered root . the intact horseradish root has hardly any aroma . when cut or grated , however , enzymes from the now-broken plant cells causes changes . the enzymes break down sinigrin to produce allyl isothiocyanate ( mustard oil ) . this irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes . once exposed to air ( by grating ) or heat , it needs to be mixed with vinegar . otherwise it becomes unpleasantly bitter-tasting . horseradish has been cultivated since ancient times . supposedly , the delphic oracle told apollo that the horseradish was worth its weight in gold . horseradish was known in egypt in 1500 bc . both root and leaves were used as a medicine during the middle ages . the root was used as a condiment on meats in germany , scandinavia , and britain . it was brought to north america during colonial times .
