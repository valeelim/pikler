Millau Viaduct     millau viaduct is a large bridge in millau , france in the département of aveyron . it was designed by the french structural engineer michel virlogeux and british architect sir norman foster . before the bridge was built , traffic had to go down into the valley of the tarn river and pass along the national route n9 near the town of millau , causing heavy congestion at the beginning and end of the july and august vacation season . the bridge now crosses the tarn valley above its lowest point , linking the causse du larzac to the causse rouge , and is inside the perimeter of the grands causses regional natural park . the bridge forms the last link of the a75 autoroute , ( la méridienne ) from clermont-ferrand to béziers . the a75 , with the a10 and a71 , provides a continuous high-speed route south from paris through clermont-ferrand to the languedoc region and through to spain , considerably reducing the cost of vehicle traffic traveling along this route . many tourists heading to southern france and spain follow this route because it is direct and without tolls for the 340 km between clermont-ferrand and pézenas , except for the bridge itself .
