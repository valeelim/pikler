PCLinuxOS     pclinuxos is a linux operating system . it is a free operating system for personal computers . it was made to be easy to use . the start of pclinuxos was a set of rpm packages created to improve successive versions of mandrake linux ( now mandriva linux ) . these packages were created by bill reynolds , a packager better known as `` texstar '' . from the year 2000 to 2003 , texstar maintained his repository of rpm packages in parallel with the pclinuxonline web site . in an interview , reynolds said he started pclinuxos `` to provide an outlet for [ his ] crazy desire to package source code without having to deal with egos , arrogance and politics . '' in 2003 texstar created a fork of mandrake linux 9.2 ( which was released in october 2003 ) . working closely with the live cd project , texstar has since developed that fork independently into a full-fledged distribution . the initial releases were successively numbered as `` previews '' i.e . p5 , p7 , p8 up to p81a , then p9 , p91 , p92 . in august 2006 three new cds/isos , numbered 0.93a , were released : `` minime '' , `` junior '' and `` big daddy '' . at the same time , the original packages that make up the kde desktop environment have been split into smaller ones , while some less essential portions of kde have been omitted from the cd . as a result , texstar was able to fit the openoffice.org package into the bigdaddy release . minime remains a minimal `` live & install '' cd for experienced users wishing to add their own selection of packages , while junior adds a few essential desktop-oriented packages , meeting the user somewhere between the two other releases . pclinuxos 2008 `` minime '' edition , was released on 2008-01-07 .
