List of medical abbreviations     medical abbreviations are a shorthand way of writing and talking by medical professionals ( people who work to help sick people ) to hurry explanation of diseases ( sickness ) , patients , or medicines ( drugs ) . this shorthand can include shortening ( making less lengthy ) of longer disease names , by cutting the word down to its base ( the latin or greek part that makes it ) . medical professionals also create ( make ) words that mean something . an example of this is `` stat '' , used to indicate ( show ) that something needs to be hurried ( done faster ) . it is from the latin `` base word '' statim , meaning quick . a very commonly ( often ) used shorthand is shortening things on order forms for patients . an example is , `` pre-op '' meaning |pre-operation| ( patient who is being prepared for surgery ) . these can be very complicated and extensive ( meaning there is a lot of them ) . despite the fact that this shorthand might make it difficult for new interns ( new doctors ) or recently trained nurses to get used to this unofficial language , it has been shown to improve ( make better ) the speed of treatment in hospitals .
