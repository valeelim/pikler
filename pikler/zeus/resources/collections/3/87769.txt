Seesaw     a seesaw ( also known as a teeter-totter ) is a long , narrow board which is fixed in the middle , a little way above the ground . when one end of the seesaw goes up the other goes down . children often like to play on seesaws . two children sit on the seesaw , one at each end . the child who is down pushes the ground with his feet so that he goes up and his friend goes down . then the friend pushes up so the first child goes down . they continue to go back and forth until they are ready to stop playing on the seesaw . it works best with two children who are about the same size , or else the heavy person will make his end stay down . on some seesaws there is room for two or three children on each end . there is a handle for each child to hold on to so that they do not fall off . in mechanics ( a kind of physics ) anything that is balanced in the middle and goes up and down like a seesaw might be described as something that `` seesaws '' .
