Coelurosauria     coelurosauria is the clade containing all theropod dinosaurs more closely related to birds than to carnosaurs . this is a varied group that includes tyrannosaurs , ornithomimosaurs , compsognathids and maniraptors ; maniraptora includes birds , the only descendents of coelurosaurs alive today . all paraves discovered so far have been coelurosaurs . it is probable that all coelurosaurs were feathered . some diagnostic characteristics of coelurosaurs include elongated arms and well-developed hinge-like ankles ( possible rotation of the ankle is reduced , which is helpful during locomotion ) . these features may be lost or modified by later coelurosaurs ( birds , for example ) . an increase in the proportion of the brain occupied by the cerebrum seems to have occurred in the coelurosauria and `` continued throughout the evolution of maniraptorans and early birds '' . a few fossil traces of the coelurosauria date back as far as the upper triassic . a possible , but not confirmed , example would be the archosaur `` protoavis '' . what has been found between then and the start of the late jurassic is fragmentary .
