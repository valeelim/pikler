Apollo 13     apollo 13 was the seventh mission of nasa 's project apollo and the third manned lunar-lander mission . the flight was commanded by jim lovell . the other astronauts on board were jack swigert and fred haise . the craft was launched successfully toward the moon , but two days after launch a faulty oxygen tank exploded , and the service module became damaged , causing a loss of oxygen and electrical power . there was a very large chance that the astronauts would die before they could return to earth . they were very short of oxygen . oxygen is not just used to breathe ; on the apollo spacecraft it was used in a device called a fuel cell to generate electricity . so they conserved their remaining air by turning off almost all their electrical equipment , including heaters . it became very cold in the spacecraft . in order to stay alive the astronauts also had to move into the apollo lunar module and make it work as a sort of `` lifeboat '' . when they approached the earth they were not sure that their parachutes , needed to slow the command module down , would work . the parachutes were thrown out by small explosive charges that were fired by batteries . the cold could have made the batteries fail , in which case the parachutes would not work and the command module would hit the ocean so fast that all aboard would be killed .
