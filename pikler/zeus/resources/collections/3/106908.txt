Wi-Fi Protected Access     wi-fi protected access ( also known as wpa and wpa2 ) is the name for a number of standards to use encryption on a wireless lan . the standards were created because researchers had found several weaknesses in wired equivalent privacy . wired equivalent privacy , or `` wep '' was the standard that came before it . the protocol `` wpa2 '' implements most of the standard ieee 802.11i . products that have the label `` wpa '' were designed to work with most cards , even those that came out before there was wpa . this is not true for access points though . products with the `` wpa2 '' implement all of the standard . this is more secure , but it may not work with some older cards .
