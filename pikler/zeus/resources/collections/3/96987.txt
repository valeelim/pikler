Ernst Haeckel     ernst haeckel ( ernst heinrich philipp august haeckel , 16 february 1834 – 9 august 1919 ) was an influential german zoologist , naturalist , and artist . he was also a philosopher and physician , but in those fields he is not regarded as particularly notable . haekel was professor of comparative anatomy at the university of jena , where he worked for 47 years , from 1862 to 1909. haekel discovered , described and named thousands of new species , mapped a tree of life relating all life forms . he coined many terms in biology , including `` ecology '' , `` phylum '' , `` phylogeny '' , `` stem cell '' , and the kingdom `` protista . '' haeckel promoted and popularised charles darwin 's work in germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory ( `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' ) . this clained that an individual organism 's biological development , or ontogeny , parallels and summarises its species ' evolutionary development . the published artwork of haeckel includes over 100 detailed , multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures . as a philosopher , ernst haeckel wrote `` die welträtsel '' ( 1895–1899 , `` the riddle of the universe '' , 1901 ) , and `` freedom in science and teaching '' to support teaching evolution .
