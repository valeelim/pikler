Aurochs     the aurochs , or urus , ( `` bos primigenius '' ) was a large species of cattle , once common in europe but now extinct . it was a wild animal , not a domesticated animal . the extinct aurochs/urus is a completely separate species from the `` wisent '' ( the european bison ) . according to the paleontologisk museum , university of oslo , aurochs developed in india some two million years ago , came into the middle east and farther into asia , and reached europe about 250,000 years ago . they were once thought a different species from modern european cattle ( `` bos taurus '' ) , but today not any more . modern cattle have become much smaller than their wild ancestors : the height of a large domesticated cow is about 1.5 meters ( 5 feet , 15 hands ) , while aurochs were about 1.75 meters ( 5.75 feet , 17 hands ) . aurochs also had several features not often seen in modern cattle , such as lyre-shaped horns set at a forward angle , a pale stripe down the spine , and different color according to the gender . males were black with a pale stripe down the spine , while females and calves were reddish ( these colours are still found in a few domesticated cattle breeds , such as jersey cattle ) . aurochs were also known to have very aggressive behaviour , and killing one was seen as an act of courage in ancient cultures .
