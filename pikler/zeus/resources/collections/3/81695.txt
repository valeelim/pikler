Pasiphaë group     the pasiphaë group is a group of retrograde non-spherical moons of jupiter that follow similar orbits to pasiphaë and are thought of have a common origin . their semi-major axes ( distances from jupiter ) range between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000 km ( the same range as the carme group ) , their inclinations between 144.5° and 158.3° , and their eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43. core members of the group include ( from the biggest to the smallest ) : - pasiphae - sinope , two-thirds the size of pasiphaë - callirrhoe - megaclite - autonoe - eurydome - sponde the international astronomical union ( iau ) reserves names ending in -e for all retrograde moons , including this group 's members . the pasiphaë group is believed to have been formed when jupiter captured an asteroid which broke up after a collision . the original asteroid was not disturbed heavily : the original body is calculated to have been 60 km in diameter , about the same size as pasiphaë ; pasiphaë has 99 % of the original body 's mass . however , if sinope belongs to the group , the amount is much smaller , 87 % .
