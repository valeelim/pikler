Lunar eclipse     a lunar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon . it happens when the moon passes through the shadow of the earth which can only occur during a full moon . lunar eclipses happen about twice a year and can be seen from a much larger portion of the earth compared to solar eclipses . lunar eclipses can last for a few hours , but solar eclipses may last only a few minutes . during a lunar eclipse , the moon looks red-brown . it may be thought that the moon is completely black because of the earth 's shadow , but the reddish-brown color is because of the fact that some of the sun 's light bends through the earth 's atmosphere and reflects off the moon . like solar eclipses , there are different types of lunar eclipses . there are total eclipses , where the moon passes completely through earth 's shadow and all of the moon appears reddish-brown . a partial eclipse occurs when only part of the moon passes through earth 's shadow and so only part of the moon appears reddish-brown . lunar eclipses are safe to view with just your eyes and also with telescopes .
