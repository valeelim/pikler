Landfall (meteorology)    landfall ( meteorology ) landfall is when a tropical cyclone or waterspout moves from being over water to being over land . when a tornadic waterspout makes landfall it can be called a tornado , and can cause damage to buildings and other things made by people . when a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it quickly spreads out and loses its energy ; the water falls as rain . a tropical cyclone is said to make landfall when its center moves over land ; in tropical cyclones this can be when the eye moves over land . this is where most of the damage occurs because when the storm is over water there is a little chance of damage , except if the parts of the storm that are raining are over land , which can cause severe flooding especially when the system is moving slowly or not at all . the effects of landfall are : - the storm surge peaks - the core of strong winds comes on shore - and heavy flooding rains move over land . together with the high surf , these can cause a lot of beach erosion . in low lying areas the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic mess . when a tropical cyclone makes landfall , the eye `` closes '' , surf gets less , and winds get less as the cyclone spreads out , losing energy . damage inland may include flooding rains , gusty winds , and severe weather associated with the cyclone 's remnant thunderstorms .
