Marie-Antoine Carême     marie antoine ( antonin ) carême ( 8 june 1784 – 12 january 1833 ) , was a french chef and author . he is well known for greatly simplifying and writing about the style of cooking known as `` haute cuisine '' , the high art of french cooking . he was known as `` chef of kings and king of chefs '' , because he cooked for royalty , and is often thought of as the first celebrity chef . carême was born paris , but was abandoned in 1792 because his parents were very very poor . he worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap paris cafe in exchange for a room and food . in 1798 , he was apprenticed to sylvain bailly , a famous `` pâtissier '' ( cake baker ) with a shop near the palais-royal . carême gained fame in paris for his cake centrepieces , which bailly put in the pâtisserie window . the centerpieces were sometimes several feet high , and were only made out of foodstuffs such as sugar , marzipan , and pastry . he modelled them on temples , pyramids , and ancient ruins which he read about in the books he studied at the french national library ( bibliothéque nationale ) . some of his sugar works were so strong that court jesters could dance on them to entertain the king .
