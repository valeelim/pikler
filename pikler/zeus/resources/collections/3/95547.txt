Finntroll     finntroll is a folk metal band from finland . they mix elements of extreme metal with finnish polka , called `` humppa '' . finntroll 's lyrics are in swedish , one of finland 's two national languages , because they say `` swedish just sounds damn trollish '' . finntroll means `` troll from finland '' or `` a spotty troll '' . finntroll was founded in 1997 , by teemus raimoranta . one year later they recorded their first demo , `` rivfader '' . after the demo samu ruotsalainen ( drums ) , samuli ponsimaa ( guitar ) , henri sorvali ( keyboard ) and sami uusitalo joined the band . the record company spinefarm got interested in the band and then their first album `` midnattens widunder '' was recorded . in 2001 the album `` jaktens tid '' ( english : `` the time of the hunt '' ) was released . as they became more and more popular , century media started to promote finntroll . that summer finntroll played their first open air festivals in finland . the year after the release of the album `` jaktens tid '' the band could not go on tour , because their singer had a tumor in his vocal cords . that is why he stopped singing in the band after the album `` visor om slutet '' ( english : `` songs about the end '' ) . this album was recorded in january 2003 , in a forest cabin near helsinki . shortly before the release of `` visor om slutet '' raimoranta died , because he fell off a bridge in helsinki . he had drunk too much alcohol . finntroll went on tour to europe anyway , together with the band katatonia . the guitarist mikael karlbom replaced raimoranta . in 2004 , the band released an ep , `` trollhammaren '' ( english : `` the troll hammer '' ) , and an album called `` nattf√∂dd '' ( english : `` nightborn '' ) .
