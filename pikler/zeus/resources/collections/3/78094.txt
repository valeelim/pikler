Christian worship     in christianity , worship has been thought as by most christians to be the central act of christian identity throughout history . many christian theologians have called humanity `` homo adorans '' , which means `` worshipping man , '' and so the worship of god is at the very centre of what it means to be human . throughout most centuries of church history , christian worship has been primarily liturgical , symbolised by prayers and hymns , whose texts were closely related to , the scripture . set times for prayer during the day were made ( based mostly on jewish models ) , and a festal cycle throughout the church year pointed out the celebration of feasts and holy days relating to the events in the life of jesus , the lives of the saints , and features of the church 's view of god . a large amount of importance was placed on the forms of worship , as they were seen in terms of the latin phrase `` lex orandi , lex credendi '' ( `` the rule of prayer is the rule of belief '' ) â€” that is , the details of someone 's worship show , teach , and govern the principle beliefs of the community . to change the patterns and content of worship were to change the faith itself . so even though there was always a certain amount of variety in the early church 's liturgical worship , there was also a great deal of unity . each time a heresy appeared in the church , it normally came by a shift in worship for the heretical group . orthodoxy in faith also meant orthodoxy in worship , and vice versa .
