Musical notation     music notation or musical notation is a way of writing down music so that anyone can play it . many systems have been used in the past to write music . today most musicians in the western world write musical notes on a stave : five parallel lines with four spaces in between them . however , there are many others , some of which are in use today in different cultures . writing music down makes it possible for a composer who makes up ( compofishes ) a piece of music to let other people know how the music is supposed to sound . that music can then be played or sung by anybody who can “ read music ” . if music is not written down , then people can only learn other people ’ s music by listening to it and trying to copy it . this is how folk music was traditionally learned . the earliest kind of musical notation was written on tablets using a way of writing called cuneiform . music from nippur from about 2000 b.c . has been found which seems to give an approximate idea of how the music should be played . a tablet from 1250 b.c . has musical notation which shows the names of the strings of a lyre . they are the earliest records we have of written music .
