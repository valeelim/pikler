Mesolithic     the mesolithic was a period in the development of human technology between the paleolithic and neolithic periods of the stone age . in the palaeolithic , people were pure hunter-gatherers . in the neolithic they were farmers in settlements with domesticated animals and wheat , with over 500 kinds of tools and with pottery . the mesolithic was a transitional period between the two . it happened at different times in different places . mesolithic tools are small tools produced by chipping , and are hunter-gatherer tools , often arrowheads and points . neolithic tools are often polished and far more varied . they are tools of more settled societies with some agriculture . the term 'mesolithic ' was introduced by hodder westrop in 1877 , though the idea had been used earlier . it was not much used until v. gordon childe popularized it in his book `` the dawn of europe '' ( 1947 ) . there is another term , 'epipalaeolithic ' , which is sometimes used instead . the type of tool is the diagnostic factor . the mesolithic featured devices made with small chipped stone tools . the neolithic mainly abandoned this mode in favor of polished , not chipped , stone tools .
