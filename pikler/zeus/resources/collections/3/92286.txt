Cistercian     the term cistercian is used to refer to an order of roman catholic monks . officially the order is called `` ordo cisterciensis '' ( `` ocist '' ) , or `` sacer ordo cisterciensis '' ( `` soc '' ) . these people follow the same rules as the benedictines , that is to say those of st benedict . over time , the benedictines made some changes to the rules and the way of life . the cistercians reject these . they went back to what st benedict had taught . sometimes their rules were more strict than those st benedict had given . they also went back to manual labour , especially work in the fields . because of this , the cistercians helped spread technologies around medieval europe . in 1882 certain monasteries formed a new order , called the trappists . with time , they split completely from the cistercians .
