Baroclinic     in fluid dynamics , the baroclinity ( sometimes called baroclinicity ) is a measure of the stratification in a fluid . a baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure ; contrast this with barotropic atmosphere , for which the density depends only on the pressure . in atmospheric terms , the barotropic zones of the earth are generally found in the central latitudes , or tropics , whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid-latitude/polar regions .
