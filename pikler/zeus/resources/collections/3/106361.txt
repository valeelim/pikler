Commensalism     commensalism is a type of relationship between two organisms . in commensalism , one organism is helped while the other is not affected . in practice , it is difficult to show that the passive organism is not harmed . for example , some birds live in holes in trees . does this damage the tree ? mites , which can not fly , often hitch a ride on insects . does this affect the insect 's fitness ? there is no definite answer to such questions . orchids , mosses , and lichens all grow on tropical trees . they need sunlight , and by being higher up they get to the sunlight . all that can be said for sure is that the trees continue to live and reproduce , and so it is assumed that these epiphytes do not affect their host plant . pierre-joseph van beneden ( 18091894 ) introduced the term into evolutionary biology and ecology in the 1870s . amensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one organism is harmed or inhibited and the other is unaffected . examples of amensalism include the shading out of one plant by a taller and wider one and the inhibition of one plant by the secretions of another ( known as allelopathy ) .
