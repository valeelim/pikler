Eusociality     eusociality is a term in animal behaviour for the more complex kinds of social organisation . the term `` eusocial '' was introduced in 1966 by suzanne batra . e.o . wilson gave it a more precise meaning . at the start , it was used for invertebrates only , usually social insects . these are its main features : 1. different animals have different jobs to do . there is a division of labour . some castes may be sterile . 1. animal generations overlap . there are different generations in the hive or nest . 1. animals cooperate to care for the young . presociality is a term for simpler ( basal ) kinds of sociality . after wilson 's original definition , others discussed it , and some wanted to change its details . the most familiar examples of eusociality are insects such as ants , bees , wasps , and termites . all of these are colonial animals which have queens for reproduction . the animals that are workers or soldiers are usually sterile - they can not have offspring . there were only two known mammal species which are eusocial . these are the naked mole rat and the damaraland mole rat .
