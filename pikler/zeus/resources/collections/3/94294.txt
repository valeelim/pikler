SOCKS     socks is an internet protocol that allows one client computer to connect to another computer via a third computer ( socks server ) . socks is an abbreviation for `` sockets '' . when a direct connection between two computers ( clients ) is not possible for some services ( e.g . http , ftp , or chat protocols like msn and aol ) , a user can use these services via a so-called socks server ( routing ) . example : bill wants to chat with jane . bill has a bad service provider who limits internet access . bill 's computer then connects to the socks server , which is able to `` chat '' with jane 's computer without restrictions . an http proxy works similar to a socks server , but is limited on routing http traffic only .
