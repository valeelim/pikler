Basilica     a basilica is a large , important church . the word can also be used for an ancient roman building that was used for law and meetings . the word `` basilica '' is latin which was taken from the greek `` basiliké stoà '' . nowadays the word is used in three ways : - a roman catholic church that has been given the right to use that name , by the pope . only some large important churches have this right . - an ancient roman basilica - people who write about architecture often use the word `` basilica '' to mean a building that is shaped like an ancient roman basilica . a roman basilica was a large hall built for meetings , business and law . a roman basilica usually had the doors at the long sides of the building . at each end was a semi-circular part where the judges sat . the building usually had two rows of columns , which made a high central part and a lower aisle on either side . the light came in from windows above the columns . as the roman empire spread , every city had a basilica . early in the 4th century ( 312 ad ) , the roman emperor constantine made christianity the legal religion of the roman empire . the christians who had been worshipping secretly in private houses now wanted to build churches . they did not want the churches to look the same as roman temples . they built them to look more like roman basilicas . a basilica was a good plan for a christian church because lots of people could fit inside , and the aisles were useful for people to move around . the semi-circular part at one end , the `` apse '' , was just right to put the altar . christian basilicas usually have the door at one end , rather than at the side . in front of the door there was often a courtyard called an `` atrium '' . most of these atriums have gone , but churches often have a town square or a market place in front of them .
