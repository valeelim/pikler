Al-Andalus     al-andalus ( arabic : الأندلس ) was the arabic name given to those parts of the iberian peninsula governed by muslims , or moors , at various times in the period between 711 and 1492. as a political domain or domains , it was successively a province of the umayyad caliphate , the caliphate of córdoba ( 929-1031 ) , and finally the caliphate of córdoba 's `` taifa '' ( successor ) kingdoms . for large parts of its history , particularly under the caliphate of córdoba , andalus was famous for learning and the city of córdoba became one of the leading cultural and economic centers in both the mediterranean basin and the islamic world . this civilization was quite advanced at architecture and urban planning . the moors were very wealthy because they controlled the gold trade from the ghana empire in west africa . they built many beautiful buildings in all the land they controlled . many of their large buildings still stand in cities in andalusia , such as in seville , granada , and cordoba . muslim spain was multicultural and tolerant ; jews , christians and muslims lived side by side . there was also a large slavic population ( `` saqaliba '' ) near the mediterranean coast . though these people were at first brought in to be slaves , some of them became generals ( as did some mamluks in another caliphate ) and some generals became rulers of their own cities ( `` taifas '' ) for a short time .
