64 Studio     64 studio is a free linux distribution based on debian made for creative users on x86-64 and legacy 32-bit hardware architectures . it is made to serve as an all-in-one solution for audio and video recording , editing , and other forms of media production . since 64 studio is distributed with a free software license , anyone with a 64-bit computer can install it on their computer ( in place of or alongside the well-known windows operating system ) . an alternative installer is available for systems with 32-bit processors . the major differences between this distribution and basic debian is a custom kernel with realtime patches applied , some pre-configuration and a custom package selection designed to meet the needs of creative desktop users . other packages may also be modified to some extent , as are the basic gnome desktop themes . the project released the first beta of 64 studio , version 0.9.0 code-named 'toe rag ' , on the august 1 , 2006. the release was named in honour of the all-analogue toe rag studios in london , england .
