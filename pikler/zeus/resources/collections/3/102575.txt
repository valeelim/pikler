Cyclamen     cyclamen is a genus of 20 species of flowering plants . it is in the myrsinaceae family . the genus is most widely known by its scientific name cyclamen . it may also be called persian violet ( it is not related to the violets ) , or primrose ( neither is it a primrose ) . this is because cyclamen has been part of the primulaceae families . cyclamen come from the mediterranean , from spain to iran . they are also found from northeast africa to somalia . they are perennial herbaceous aestivating plants , with a surface or underground tuber ( derived from the hypocotyl ) 4-12 cm diameter , which produces leaves in late winter , and flowers in the autumn ; the leaves die down during the hottest part of the mediterranean summer drought to save water . each leaf or flower grows on its own stem , which shoots up from the hypocotyl . the variegation is thought by some botanists to be a form of natural disruptive camouflage to reduce grazing damage by animals . the hypocotyl grows leaves and flowers on stems , either one flower or one leaf per stem . the stem for leaves and flowers appears identical except in height . the leaves grow on stems of around 6 cm height .
