Hurley (stick)    hurley ( stick ) a hurley is a wooden stick measuring between 70 and 100 cm ( 26 to 40 inches ) long with a flattened , curved end ( called the `` bas '' ) , used to hit a `` sliotar '' ( leather ball ) in the irish sport of hurling . it is also used in camogie , the female equivalent , and there often called a camogie stick . hurleys are made from ash wood , and are usually bought from local craftsmen in ireland , who still use traditional production methods . no matter how well crafted the hurley is , a hurler may well expect to use several hurleys over the course of the hurling season . the hurleys often break if two collide in the course of a game , or occasionally they break off on the other players ( arms , legs , etc. ) . two hurleys colliding is colloquially known as `` the clash of the ash . '' throwing the hurley ( e.g . to block a ball going high over one 's head ) is illegal , but camogie players may drop it to make a handpass .
