Prose     prose is the ordinary form of the written ( or spoken ) language . it is not poetry . it does not use any special format such as lists or tables . in writing , it is without special rhythm . it is similar to everyday communication . that is what makes the most important distinction with poetry , and with theatrical works such as plays . the word prose comes from the latin `` prosa '' , meaning straightforward , hence the term `` prosaic '' . prose writing is usually adopted for the description of facts or the discussion of whatever one 's thoughts are , incorporated in free flowing speech . it may be used for newspapers , novels , magazines , encyclopedias , broadcast media , letters , stories , history , philosophy , biography , and many other forms of media . prose generally has no formal structure , like meter or rhyme , that is often found in poetry . therefore , it is used to describe literature which is non-poetic , and non-theatrical . there is , however , a blend of the two forms of literature known as `` prose poetry '' .
