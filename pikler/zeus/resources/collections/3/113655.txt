Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany     nazi germany started a strong anti-tobacco movement and led the first public anti-smoking campaign in modern history . anti-tobacco movements grew in many countries from the beginning of the 20th century . but all these had little success . the only exception was germany where it was supported by the government after the nazis came to power . it was the most powerful anti-smoking movement in the world in the 1930s and early 1940s . the nazi leaders opposed smoking and some of them openly said what is wrong with tobacco consumption . research on smoking and its effects on health got better under nazi rule and was the most important of its type at that time . adolf hitler did not like tobacco and the nazi reproductive policies were among the causes due to which the nazis started their campaign against smoking . this campaign was linked with antisemitism and racism . the nazi anti-tobacco campaign used many methods like restrictions on smoking in public spaces , limiting tobacco advertising , restrictions on tobacco rations for women , restrictions on restaurants and coffeehouses , promoting health education , banning smoking in trams , buses and city trains , limiting cigarette rations in the wehrmacht , organizing medical lectures for soldiers and increasing the tobacco tax . the anti-tobacco movement did not have much effect in the early years of the nazi rule . tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939. but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. this anti-smoking campaign was more powerful and serious than the anti-tobacco movement in germany at the beginning of the 21st century .
