Isomer     an isomer in chemistry is a chemical that has the same molecular formula as another , but it has a different arrangement of atoms in space . different isomers have different chemical properties ( that is , they may look , or smell , or taste different from each other ) . there are two main categories : stereoisomers and structural isomers . structural isomers are isomers with the atoms making up the molecule joined together in different ways . stereoisomers have different positions of atoms in space and are much more subtle than structural isomers .
