Monophysitism     monophysitism is an idea about the nature of jesus christ . it says that christ only has one nature , namely the divine one . there are two main doctrines that can be called monophysite ( ) : eutychianism says that the human and divine natures of christ were combined into one new single ( mono ) nature : his human nature was `` dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea '' . apollinarism or apollinarianism says that christ had a human body and human `` living principle '' but that the divine logos had taken the place of the `` nous '' , or `` thinking principle '' . this is analogous but not identical to what might be called a mind in the present day . after nestorianism , taught by nestorius , archbishop of constantinople , was refused at the first council of ephesus , eutyches , an archimandrite at constantinople came up with new views . monophysitism and eutyches were also refused at the council of chalcedon in 451. monophysitism is also rejected by the oriental orthodox churches , but was widely accepted in syria , the levant , and egypt . this caused many tensions in the early days of the byzantine empire .
