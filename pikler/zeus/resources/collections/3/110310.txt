Sauroposeidon     sauroposeidon is a genus of sauropod dinosaur found in oklahoma . it is one of the biggest dinosaur yet found . sauroposeidon lived in what was then a river delta flowing into the bay of mexico . it was a plant-eater that probably ate leaves from the tops of trees , perhaps conifers and early flowering trees like magnolias , palms , and sycamores . estimates of `` sauroposeidons size are based on a comparison between the four `` sauroposeidon '' vertebrae and the vertebrae of the hm sii specimen of `` giraffatitan '' in the humboldt museum in berlin . the hm sii is the most complete brachiosaur known . comparisons to the other relatives of `` sauroposeidon '' are difficult due to limited remains . the neck length of `` sauroposeidon '' is estimated at , compared to a neck length of for the hm sii `` giraffatitan '' . this is based on the assumption that the rest of the neck has the same proportions as `` giraffatitan '' , which is a reasonably good conjecture . `` sauroposeidon '' was probably able to raise its head above the ground , which is as high as a six-story building . in comparison , `` giraffatitan '' could probably raise its head into the air .
