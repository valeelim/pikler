West Berlin     west berlin was the name of the western part of berlin between 1949 and 1990. it was the american , british , and french occupied sectors that were created in 1945. in many ways it was integrated ( joined ) with west germany , but it was not a part of west germany or east germany . the soviet sector became east berlin , which east germany claimed as its capital . the western allies never recognised this claim . they said that the whole city was still under four-power occupation . the building of the berlin wall in 1961 sealed the border between east berlin and west berlin . west berlin was called `` berlin ( west ) '' by the west germany government , and usually by the east german government . the east german spelling suggested that west berlin was not really part of `` berlin '' as a whole , but a separate place . east berlin was officially called `` berlin , hauptstadt der ddr '' ( `` berlin , capital of the gdr '' ) , or simply `` berlin , '' by east germany . the potsdam agreement of the four wartime allies decided on dividing up germany . at first it was only a temporary measure , until a permanent way to reunite a peaceful germany and berlin could be worked out .
