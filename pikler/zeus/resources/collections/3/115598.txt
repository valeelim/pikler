Allele frequency     allele frequency refers to the different forms of a gene at a single position on a chromosome . it is the proportion of a given allele to all alleles at the same locus . it is usually expressed as a percentage . allele frequencies may be used to describe genetic diversity in a population . if the frequency of any allele is above 1 % it is probable that natural selection is maintaining it at this level . this is because the natural mutation rate of an allele is almost always much lower than 1 % . a fixed allele is one allele that exists for a particular population . a fixed allele is homozygous for all members of the population . the term `` allele '' refers to one variant gene out of several possible for a particular locus in the dna . when all but one allele go away , one only remains . that allele is said to be fixed .
