Trolleybus     a trolleybus ( also known as trolley bus , trolley coach , trackless trolley , trackless tram or simply trolley ) is a bus which runs on electricity . it gets its power for the electric motors that drive the wheels from a pair of power lines above the street . on the roof of the bus are two `` trolley poles '' from which electric current flows between the wires and the bus . one wire is for the positive current and the other is for the negative ( return ) current . because trolleybuses do not usually have engines which burn diesel or other fossil fuels , they are much cleaner and quieter than `` normal '' buses . they also do not use tracks , so they are more flexible than trams . but as these buses often can not run without power from the wires , their range is still limited compared to ordinary buses . trolleybuses cost more money to make than other types of buses , so there are not many companies that build this type of bus . some of these companies are : - vanhool - man - hess - solaris - Å¡koda electric
