The Wealth of Nations     an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations is better known simply as the wealth of nations . it was written by adam smith in 1776. it looks at division of work , following self-interest , and freedom of trade . the book was the beginning of classical economics , and market economics . smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves , the result would be best for society . before that , economics was about the king 's personal interests , and the wealth of a nation was measured by the king 's treasury . smith said what 's important is what 's best for the whole nation , and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation . he wanted to discover how wealth can grow , and how people could do things to support that growth . smith 's book said land , labor , and capital were the three `` factors of production '' and the main contributors to a nation 's wealth . prices naturally adjust to having more or less of something : supply and demand . if there is too much of something ( more supply ) , prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it . if a lot of people want something ( high demand ) , there may not be enough of it ( scarcity ) ; there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it , and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want , and prices go up .
