Predicate logic     predicate logic is a system of mathematical logic . it uses predicates to express the state of certain things . it is different from propositional logic because it has the concept of `` quantifiers '' . this means , that it can also express things about quantity . the best-known quantifiers are the `` existence quantifier '' ( ∃ ) and the `` universal quantifier '' ( ∀ ) . the existence quantifier says that there is at least one ( thing ) that matches the predicate or formula . the universal quantifier says that all the things match a certain predicate or formula .
