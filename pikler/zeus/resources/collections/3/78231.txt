List of elements     this page shows a list of all 118 chemical elements that have been identified . notes . - the element does not have any stable nuclides , and a value in brackets , e.g . [ 209 ] , indicates the mass number of the longest-lived isotope of the element . however , three elements , thorium , protactinium , and uranium , have a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition , and thus their atomic mass given . - the isotopic composition of this element varies in some geological specimens , and the variation may exceed the uncertainty stated in the table . - the isotopic composition of the element can vary in commercial materials , which can cause the atomic weight to deviate significantly from the given value . - the isotopic composition varies in terrestrial material such that a more precise atomic weight can not be given . - the atomic weight of commercial lithium can vary between 6.939 and 6.996â€“analysis of the specific material is necessary to find a more accurate value . - this element does not solidify at a pressure of one atmosphere . the value listed above , 0.95 k , is the temperature at which helium does solidify at a pressure of 25 atmospheres .
