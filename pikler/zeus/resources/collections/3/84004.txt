Tropical Storm Debby (2006)    tropical storm debby ( 2006 ) tropical storm debby was the fifth tropical storm of the 2006 atlantic hurricane season . debby formed just off the coast of africa on august 21 from a tropical wave . after passing near the cape verde islands , debby moved generally northwestward for much of its life , reaching a peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km/h ) . strong wind shear weakened the storm , and debby dissipated on august 27 over the northern atlantic ocean . early in its life , debby was forecasted to pass through the southern cape verde islands as a tropical storm , possibly causing life-threatening flooding . most computer models consistently predicted debby to move to the northwest throughout its lifetime , though intensity was more of a problem for forecasters . the national hurricane center continually predicted debby to strengthen into hurricane status , though strong vertical shear eventually prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane . a strong tropical wave moved off the coast of africa late on august 20 , and almost convective banding and a broad circulation . a large area of low pressure formed within the wave the next day while located 260 miles southeast of the cape verde islands . though convection decreased early on august 21 , the area of low pressure stayed well-organized and the system developed into tropical depression four late on august 21. water temperatures remained warm enough for development , while upper level shear was minimal as the depression moved west-northwestward because of a ridge of high pressure to its north . original predictions by the national hurricane center also forecasted a turn to the northwest based computer model predictions , as quoted by forecaster james franklin , `` the models have also been excellently wrong thus far '' .
