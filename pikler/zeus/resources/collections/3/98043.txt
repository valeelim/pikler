Radiocarbon dating     radiocarbon dating , also known as the c14 dating method , is a way of telling how old an object is . it is a type of radiometric dating . the method uses the radioactive isotope carbon-14 . most organic matter contains carbon . carbon has different isotopes , which are usually not radioactive ; c is the radioactive one , its half-life , or time it takes to radioactively decay to one half its original amount , is about 5,730 years . this makes it possible to tell the age of substances that contain carbon . the method works to about 60,000 years old . dates obtained are usually written as `` before present '' ( 'present ' is 1950 ) . plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthesis , and are eaten by animals , so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon-14 with its environment as long as it lives . once it dies , however , this exchange stops . in 1958 hessel de vries showed that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere varies with time and locality . the relatively short-lived c is constantly renewed by cosmic ray bombardment on atmospheric nitrogen . since the bombardment is slightly variable , and for other reasons , the c taken into organic matter is also slightly variable . that leads to errors in the chronology . however , under about 20,000 years the results can be compared with dendrochronology , based on tree rings . for the most accurate work , variations are compensated by means of calibration curves .
