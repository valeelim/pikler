Sloth     sloths are xenarthran mammals from central and south america . they are part of the order pilosa . there are two families of sloths : two-toed sloth and three-toed sloth . most scientists call these two families the folivora , while some call them the phyllophaga . the biogeographic origins of the pilosa is still unclear , but they can be traced back in south america as far as the early tertiary , about 60 million years ago . the presence of these animals in central america is explained by the great american interchange . most sloths are about the size of a small dog and they have short , flat heads . their hair is grayish brown but , at times they look grey-green in color because they move so slowly that tiny camouflaging algae grow all over their coats . they have hooklike claws on their arms and legs to keep them attached to trees . sloths are active at night and sleep curled up with their head placed between the arms and the feet drawn close together , or hanging upsidedown with the help of their hook-like claws . this disguises them as part of a tree so that its enemies like the jaguar do not see them . sloths rarely climb down from the trees , and when they are on the ground they can only crawl awkwardly . however , when there is a forest flood , they are very good swimmers . sloths can live for up to 30 years . they mostly just eat leaves and flowers , which take a very long time to digest .
