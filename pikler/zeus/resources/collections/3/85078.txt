High five     a high five is a hand gesture done with two people . the five refers to the five fingers on each hand . it might mean `` good job ! '' . high fives are not done because a person is mad at someone else , even though doing one may hurt . to do a high five , both people open one hand and raise it , and slap them together . it is morally wrong to slap someone in the face , instead of the hand . sometimes this is confusing . depending on the situation , a high-five may be changed to a slap-n-slide of the palms .
