Alhazen     alhazen or alhacen or ibn al-haytham ( 965–1039 ) was a pioneer of modern optics . some have also described him as a `` pioneer of the modern scientific method '' and `` first scientist '' , but others think this overstates his contribution . alhazen 's `` risala fi ’ l-makan '' ( treatise on place ) discussed theories on the motion of a body . he maintained that a body moves perpetually unless an external force stops it or changes its direction of motion . he laid foundations for telescopic astronomy . he was an arab or persian muslim polymath who made contributions to the principles of optics , as well as to anatomy , engineering , mathematics , medicine , , philosophy , physics , psychology , muslim theology , visual perception . he is sometimes called al-basri ( arabic : البصري ) , after his birthplace in the city of basra in iraq ( mesopotamia ) . alhazen lived mainly in cairo , egypt , dying there at age 74. over-confident about practical application of his mathematical knowledge , he thought he could regulate the floods of the nile . when he was ordered by al-hakim bi-amr allah , the sixth ruler of the fatimid caliphate , to carry out this operation , he realized he could not do it , and retired from engineering . fearing for his life , he pretended to be mad , and was placed under house arrest . for the rest of his life he devoted himself entirely to his scientific work .
