Secondary sex characteristic     secondary sex characteristics are features which make it possible to tell the sexes of a species apart . they are not directly linked to reproduction . male birds usually have much more colourful feathers ( plumage ) , the females are usually better able to hide , because their plumage is camouflaged . well-known secondary sex characteristics in humans are the deeper voice , facial hair ( mustache and beard ) and more muscular build in men . in women , those characteristics usually cited are more prominent breasts , lips , eyes , long/fast growing hair , no facial hair , wider hips , more fat , and generally a higher voice . faces , generally , make a big impact . it is the part other people interact with . however , the wider hips are needed to give birth . babies are born through the space between the three bones of a woman 's pelvis . so is doubtful to call this a `` secondary '' characteristic , except so far as the width helps attract mates . breasts are also essential , but in humans they are much larger in proportion to other mammals , and they do serve to attract males .
