Video card     in computing , a video card ( also called a graphics card or a graphics accelerator ) is a special circuit board that controls what is shown on a computer monitor and calculates 3d images and graphics . a video card can be used to display a two-dimensional ( 2d ) image like a windows desktop , or a three-dimensional ( 3d ) image like a computer game . computer-aided design ( cad ) programs are often used by architects and designers to create 3d models on their computers . if a computer has a very fast video card , the architect can create very detailed 3d models . most computers have a basic video and graphics capabilities built-in to the computer 's motherboard . these `` integrated '' video chips are not as fast as in separate or `` discrete '' graphics cards . they are fast enough for basic computer use and basic computer games . if a computer user wants faster and more detailed graphics , a video card can be installed . video cards have their own processor ( called a graphics processing unit or gpu ) . the gpu separate from the main computer processor ( called the central processing unit or cpu ) . the cpu 's job is to process all the calculations needed to make the computer function . the gpu 's job is to handle 3d graphics calculations so the cpu does not have to . 3d graphics calculations take a lot of cpu power , so having a video card to handle the graphics calculations lets the cpu focus on other things like running computer programs .
