Permutation     a permutation is a single way of arranging a group of objects . it is useful in mathematics . a permutation can be changed into another permutation by simply switching two or more of the objects . for example , the way four people can sit in a car is a permutation . if some of them chose different seats , it would be a different permutation . the factorial has special application in defining the number of permutations in a set which does not include repetitions . the number n ! is precisely the number of ways we can rearrange n things into a new order . for example , if we have three fruit : an orange , apple and pear , we can eat them in the order mentioned , or we can change them e.g . an apple , then a pear and finally an orange . the exact number of permutations is then formula_1 . the number gets extremely large as the number of items ( n ) goes up .
