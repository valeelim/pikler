Corythosaurus     corythosaurus is a genus of ornithopod . it was a large plant-eating duck-billed dinosaur . it was about 30-33 feet ( 9-10 m ) long , 6.6 feet ( 2 m ) tall at the hips , and weighed 3-5 tons . like other hadrosaurs , it had a hollow , bony crest on top of its long head in the shape of a helmet flattened on the sides ( corythosaurus means `` helmet lizard '' ) . its likely functions were sound projection and recognition . males had larger crests than females and juveniles . corythosaurus was like other hadrosaurids , and could move on both two legs and all fours , as shown by footprints of related animals . it had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping . the hands had four fingers , lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand , while the second , third , and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves , suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support . the fifth finger was free and could be used to manipulate objects . each foot had only the three central toes .
