Gas chamber     a gas chamber is an airtight room used for killing people or animals with poison gas . the people or animals are put into the gas chamber , the door is sealed airtight from the outside , and a gas , such as carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide , is put into the chamber . the victims die from breathing in the poisonous gas . in the united states , prisons have used gas chambers to execute prisoners who were given the death penalty . the first person in the united states to be executed in a gas chamber was gee jon . this was in a prison in nevada , in 1924. the government of nevada did not want to use an electric chair , and thought hanging was cruel and inhumane . by the 1990s , the gas chamber had become less popular in the united states . people began to think that it was too painful of a way to die . when donald eugene harding was executed in arizona in 1992 , witnesses described his death as `` violent '' and an `` ugly event '' . the last person to be executed in the gas chamber in the united states was walter lagrand . this was in arizona in 1999. now , most states that still have the death penalty use lethal injection .
