Coaxial cable     a coaxial cable is a special electrical cable . it is used to transmit signals . the cable is specially insulated . this makes it quite stiff . today , coaxial cables are used for things like cable tv . coaxial cables can also be used for computer networks , but this is rarely the case now , as twisted pair cables can be used more easily in this area . such cables are usually made of a conducting wire . then there is some insulation , then there is another layer of conducting material . finally there is the ( insulating ) mantle . such cables are used as a high-frequency transmission line to carry a high-frequency or broadband signal . because the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists ( ideally ) only in the space between the inner and outer conductors , it can not interfere with or suffer interference from external electromagnetic fields . there are different types of coaxial cables , which satisfy different standards . timeline . - 1880 â€” coaxial cable patented in england by oliver heaviside , patent no . 1,407 .
