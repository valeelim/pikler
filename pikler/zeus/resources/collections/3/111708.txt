Autofocus     autofocus is a procedure for finding the correct position of the lens for a scene . the autofocus feature can be provided in a system which includes a movable optical element , a motor , an image sensor and a processing unit . the autofocus procedure is done by changing the lense position and image quality measurements in each position . the position that provides the image with the best quality will be used as the best focus . the image quality may be estimated using image gradients . to speed-up the autofocus procedure , the autofocus is done in two steps : the first run over the full range of the lenses movement with a significant step will provide the estimated position which will be improved in the second run over the small range with a small step . interpolation between the few best positions may improve the results accuracy .
