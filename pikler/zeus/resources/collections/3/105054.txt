Kingdom of Kerma     the kingdom of kerma was a state in nubia from around 2500 bc to about 1520 bc . it was based in the city of kerma in upper nubia and was a major centre during the middle kingdom period of egypt . it had a distinct civilization ( for example very fine and original ceramics have been found ) . the site of kerma includes both an extensive town and a cemetery consisting of large tumuli . because one can find there much examples of nubian culture and burial practices at the site , scholars think that the egyptian statues and other egyptian objects found at kerma arrived through trade . in 2003 , a swiss archaeological team working in northern sudan uncovered one of the most remarkable egyptological finds in recent years . at the site known as kerma , near the third cataract of the nile , archaeologist charles bonnet and his team discovered a ditch within a temple from the ancient city of pnoubs , which contained seven monumental black granite statues . magnificently sculpted , and in an excellent state of preservation , they portrayed five pharaonic rulers , including taharqa and tanoutamon , the last two pharaohs of the 'nubian ' dynasty , when egypt was ruled by kings from the lands of modern-day sudan . for over half a century , the nubian pharaohs governed a combined kingdom of egypt and nubia , with an empire stretching from the delta to the upper reaches of the nile .
