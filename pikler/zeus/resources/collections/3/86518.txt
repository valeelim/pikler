Tulku     a tulku ( also tülku , trulku ) is a tibetan buddhist lama who has achieved the ability to consciously determine to be reborn , often many times , in order to continue their bodhisattva vow . the most famous example is the lineage of dalai lamas , who are said to be reincarnations of the previous thirteen dalai lamas , beginning with gendun drup ( 1391 – 1474 ) . it is held in the vajrayana tradition that the oldest lineage of tulkus is that of the karmapas ( spiritual head of the karma kagyu lineage ) , which began with düsum khyenpa ( 1110-1193 ) . in addition to tibetans and related peoples , tibetan buddhism is the traditional religion of the mongols and their relatives . the mongolian word for a tulku is `` qubilγan '' , though such persons may also be called by the honorific title `` qutuγtu '' ( tib : `` 'phags-pa '' / skt : `` ārya '' ) , or `` hutagt '' in the standard khalkha dialect . a recent chinese word for tulku is `` huófó '' ( 活佛 ) , which literally means `` living buddha '' . thus the term living buddha is used to mean `` tulku '' .
