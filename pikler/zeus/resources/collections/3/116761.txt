Content Scramble System     the content scrambling system ( or content scramble system ) is a system to encrypt and copy-protect dvds . such systems are generally called digital rights management ( or `` drm '' ) systems . css uses symmetric cryptography . it was introduced in 1996 ; today , it is considered ineffective . in october 1999 , jon lech johansen and two other people ( who remained anonymous ) broke the system . css uses 40-bit cryptographic keys ; because of different design problems , the effective key length is only about 16 bits . a 450 mhz processor , current at the time could brute force crack this in less than a minute . a modern processor such as the core i7 or athlon 64 can crack it in a few seconds . css requires special information in the lead-in ( a special area ) of the disc . since the lead-in can not be changed on recordable dvds these can not have css protection ( with a few exceptions , some professional drives allow writing css keys to recordable discs ) . libdvdcss is an open-source implementation used by many dvd software players , including vlc media player . libdvdcss is region-free ; it can read foreign-region dvds even when the keys ca n't be read from the drive , by using a brute-force attack .
