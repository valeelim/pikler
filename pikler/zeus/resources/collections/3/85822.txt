Cypher     a cipher ( or cypher ) is an algorithm for performing encryption ( coding ) or decryption ( decoding ) . it is a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure . to encipher or encode is to convert information from plain text into cipher or code . in non-technical usage , a 'cipher ' is the same thing as a 'code ' ; but in cryptography , ciphers are distinguished from codes . one 20th century source gives this explanation : a cipher is `` a method in which the basic unit of concealment is the letter . in comparison , a code is a form of concealment in which the basic unit is the word '' . 21st century cryptography mostly encrypts bitstreams . codes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase . for example , `` uqjhse '' could be the code for `` proceed to the following coordinates '' . a cipher is used to turn the original information ( `` plaintext '' ) to the encrypted form `` ciphertext '' . the ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message , but can not be read by human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it .
