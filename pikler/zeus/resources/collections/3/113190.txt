Ontology     ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of `` being , `` becoming '' , existence '' , or `` reality '' . it is part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics . ontology deals with questions about what things exist or can be said to exist , and how such entities can be grouped according to similarities and differences . ontology asks whether `` categories of being '' are fundamental . some philosophers , of the platonic school , say that all nouns ( including abstract nouns ) refer to actual entities . other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities . they think some are a kind of shorthand for a collection of either objects or events . in this view , `` mind '' , instead of referring to an entity , refers to a collection of `` mental events '' experienced by a `` person '' . `` society '' refers to a collection of `` persons '' with some shared characteristics , and `` geometry '' refers to a collection of a specific kind of intellectual activity . between these poles , called realism and nominalism , are other positions . any ontology must give an account of which words refer to entities , which do not , why , and what categories result .
