Neume     a neume is a way to write music . neumes were mainly in the middle ages before the modern system of musical notation was developed . sometimes they are also called neum in english . neumes are different from modern notation : - there is no exact idea of how high or low tune should be sung ; there are only indications . - neumes do not show rhythm , extra symbols are used to show rhythm or intonation today , neumes are still used for some chants in christian churches , especially catholic and eastern orthodox ones
