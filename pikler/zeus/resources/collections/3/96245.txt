Ethylene     ethylene or ethene is a chemical compound with two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms in each molecule . these molecules are put together with a double bond that makes it a hydrocarbon . it is very important in industry and has even been used in biology as a hormone . it is also the most made chemical . about 75 million tons of it have been made each year since 2005. its biggest use is to make polyethylene . since 1795 , ethylene was called an `` olefiant gas '' , or `` oil making gas '' . this was because it came together with chlorine to make the `` oil of the dutch chemists '' . in 1866 , the german chemist august wilhelm von hofmann came up with a system for naming hydrocarbons . the suffixes -ane , -ene , -ine , -one , and -une were used to call the hydrocarbons with 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 fewer hydrogen atoms than the alkane it came from . because of this system , ethylene became ethene . in 1979 , the iupac decided that ethylene would stay ethylene . ethylene is made in the chemical industry by steam cracking . some of the parts of an ethylene plant can be :
