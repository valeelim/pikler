SOS     sos ( · · · — — — · · · ) is a morse code . it is used as distress code , to signal danger . it was introduced by the german government in radio regulations on april 1 , 1905. it became the worldwide standard when it was included in the second international radiotelegraphic convention , which was signed on november 3 , 1906. the convention became effective on july 1 , 1908. from the beginning , the sos distress signal has actually been a continuous sequence of three-dits/three-dahs/three-dits , all run together without letter spacing . in international morse code , three dits form the letter s , and three dahs make the letter o , so `` sos '' became an easy way to remember the correct order of the dits and dahs . in modern terminology , sos is a `` procedural signal '' or `` prosign '' , and the formal way to write it is with a bar above the letters . it should be written sos . in popular usage , sos became associated with phrases such as `` save our souls , '' `` save our ship '' , and others . it is mostly known by `` save our ship '' . however , these phrases were a later development , most likely as a mnemonic to help remember the correct letters—something known as a backronym . in reality the signal sos is not an acronym and does n't stand for anything .
