Idol     an idol is a religious item that represents a god . it can also mean someone who is admired by many people , like a pop idol . idolatry refers to the worship of idols . christians disagree about what idolatry is . catholicism and eastern orthodoxy see christian art and icons as good , because they see christ 's incarnation as having made images of god lawful . however many protestants regard much catholic art as idolatry . this is due to differences in the understanding of the ten commandments . `` you shall have no other gods before me . you shall not make for yourself a graven image , or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth ; you shall not bow down to them or serve them ; for i the lord your god am a jealous god , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me , but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments . '' ( rsv exodus 20:3-6 )
