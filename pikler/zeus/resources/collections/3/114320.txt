Waveform     the waveform is the shape of a wave as it travels . there are many different waveforms . they are usually a shape which is repeated over and over ( a `` periodic waveform '' ) . a common waveform is the sine wave . it is normally not possible to see a waveform without some device . the amplitude of a waveform may change a lot . even though it changes , the waveform has a root mean square ( rms ) value . for example : in the uk , the ac mains supply is a sine wave and has a voltage of 240 v. this is an rms voltage . the actual voltage varies : the amplitude of the sine wave keeps changing from -339.4 v to +339.4 v. root mean square is important . it lets us work out many useful things , like power and heating in a wire . this table has information about working out the rms for some waveforms .
