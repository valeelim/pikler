Rock (geology)    rock ( geology ) a rock is a naturally occurring solid . it is made of minerals ( which are crystalline ) , or other mineral-like substances . the minerals in the rocks vary , making different kinds of rock . the earth 's outer solid layer , the lithosphere , is made of rock . that means the earth 's crust is made of rock . rock is often covered by soil or water . it is beneath the oceans , lakes , and rivers of the earth , and under the polar icecaps . petrology is the scientific study of rocks . rocks are classified by their minerals and chemical make-up . the processes that formed them are also noted . rocks may be igneous , sedimentary and metamorphic . rock types may change in a so-called 'rock cycle ' . igneous rocks are formed when molten magma cools , either above or below the surface . they are divided into two main categories : plutonic rock and volcanic rock . plutonic or intrusive rocks are made when magma cools and crystallizes slowly within the earth 's crust ( example granite ) . volcanic or extrusive rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as lava or ejecta ( examples pumice and basalt ) .
