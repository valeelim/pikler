Outer Hebrides     the outer hebrides , often called the western isles , make up an island chain off the west coast of scotland . it is also a parliamentary constituency . the northern island is lewis and harris . south of lewis and harris is a series of islands , such as south uist , benbecula and north uist . the outer herides includes a number of even smaller islands . the isles form part of the hebrides , and are separated from the scottish mainland and from the inner hebrides by the stormy waters of the minch , the little minch and the sea of the hebrides . formerly the dominant language of the islands , scottish gaelic remains spoken even though it has now been largely supplanted by english in some parts . sea transport is crucial and a variety of ferry services operate between the islands and to mainland britain . the western isles became part of the `` su√∞reyjar '' kingdom of the norse , who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to scotland by the treaty of perth in 1266. control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs .
