Bad Doberan Minster     along the `` european street of gothic brick architecture '' in north eastern germany , close to the old hanse city of rostock , is the minster of bad doberan , the ex-cistercian abbey dedicated in 1368. the first abbey in mecklenburg , founded in 1171 , which was also used as the burial site for the regional rulers , became important both politically and historically . through the activities of its inhabitants , the abbey greatly contributed to the cultural and economic development of mecklenburg and became the centre of christianity in this region . no other cistercian abbey in europe can lay claim to such a large amount of the original interior remaining intact . among the treasures are the main altar which is the oldest wing-altar in art history , the monumental cross altar and the sculpted tomb of danish queen margarete sambiria . even after the reformation and the dissolution of the abbey in 1552 , the church continued to serve as the main burial place for the ruling mecklenburg nobility as well as the place of worship for the evangelical-lutheran congregation .
