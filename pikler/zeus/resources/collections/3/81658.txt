Galilean moons     the galilean moons are the four satellites of jupiter found by galileo galilei : io , europa , ganymede , and callisto . they are by far the biggest of the many moons of jupiter . galileo galilei found what came to be known as the galilean moons around december 1609 or january 1610. as a result of improvements he made to the telescope , galileo was able to see celestial bodies better than ever before in human history . using his improved telescope , galileo was the first to see four moons of jupiter . on january 7 , 1610 , galileo wrote a letter containing the first mention of jupiter ’ s moons . at the time , he only saw three of them , and he believed them to be fixed stars near jupiter . he continued to look at them from january 8 through march 2. in these observations , he found a fourth body , and also observed that the four were not fixed stars , but rather were orbiting jupiter. < ref name= '' galilei/helden , 15-16 '' > galilei/helden , 15-16. < /ref > galileo ’ s discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers . it showed there were objects in space to be found , which were not seen by the naked eye . more importantly , the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than the earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted ptolemaic world system . this held that the earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it . that jupiter has four moons while earth has only one further undercut the near-universal belief that the earth was the center of the universe both in position and in importance . galileo 's `` sidereus nuncius '' ( `` starry messenger '' ) , which announced celestial observations through his telescope , does not mention copernican heliocentrism , a theory that placed the sun at the center of the universe . nevertheless , galileo believed in the copernican theory .
