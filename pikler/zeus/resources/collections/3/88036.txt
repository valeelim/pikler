Munro     a munro is a scottish mountain with a height over 3,000 feet ( 914.4 metres ) . they are named after sir hugh munro ( 1856â€“1919 ) , who produced the first attempt at a catalogue of such hills , known as `` munro 's tables '' , in 1891. munro did not set any measure of relative height by which a peak qualified as a separate mountain , and much debate has since taken place over how distinct two hills must be if they are to be considered as two separate munros . despite their modest height , walking and climbing in the scottish mountains may be made dangerous by their latitude and exposure to atlantic weather systems . even in summer , conditions can be very bad ; thick fog , strong winds , driving rain and freezing summit temperatures are not unusual . winter of certain munros are widely accepted to provide among the most challenging ice climbs in europe . some walkers are unprepared for the often extreme weather conditions on the exposed tops and many fatalities are recorded every year , often resulting from slips on wet rock or ice .
