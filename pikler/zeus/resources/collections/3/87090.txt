Consonance and dissonance     in music , consonance and dissonance are words which are used to describe certain musical intervals or chords . the adjectives are consonant and dissonant . a consonant interval or chord is one which sounds stable and pleasant . it could , for example , be the end of a piece of music . for example : c and e sound well together , or the chord c , e and g ( a c major chord ) . a dissonant interval or chord is one which sounds unstable . it may even sound harsh by itself . the notes seem to clash . it can not be the end of the piece of music ( if the music is a normal , traditional tonal piece ) . it sounds as if it wants to move on to a consonant interval ( this is called `` resolving '' onto a consonant chord ) . the notes c and fsharp together make a dissonant interval . the chord c - dsharp - fsharp is a dissonant interval : it is full of tension , and it sounds as if it wants to `` resolve '' onto c - e - g. scientifically a consonant interval is one in which the two notes vibrate at frequencies which have a simple mathematical relationship , e.g . in two notes which are an octave apart the higher note vibrates exactly twice as fast . if they are a fifth apart the top note vibrates 1 1/2 times as fast as the lower note . the more complicated mathematically the interval , the more dissonant it will sound .
