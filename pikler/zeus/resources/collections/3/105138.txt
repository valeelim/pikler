Limnology     limnology is the study of waters that are not part of the oceans or seas . this includes rivers , lakes , swamps , streams , wetlands , water under the ground , and even bodies of water made by people . scientists who study this are called `` limnologists '' . their work includes biology , chemistry , physics , geology , and hydrology . the `` international society of limnology '' promotes limnology to scientists throughout the world . there are many centres for such research throughout the world . limnology helps to explain why some lakes have lots of plants and animals and some have very few . the freshwater biological association which is based next to windermere in england did a lot of the early work . limnologists there worked out why deep lakes have cold water at the bottom in summer-time but not in winter . the reason was that winds in autumn mix the waters up .
