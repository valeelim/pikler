87 Sylvia     87 sylvia is one of the biggest main-belt asteroids . it is a member of the cybele group . it is beyond the middle of the belt . sylvia is famous for being the first asteroid known to have more than one moon . sylvia was found by n. r. pogson on may 16 , 1866 from madras ( chennai ) , india . paul herget , in his `` the names of the minor planets '' ( 1955 ) , attributes the name as honouring the first wife of astronomer camille flammarion , sylvie petiaux-hugo flammarion ( this entry is signed by a. paluzie-borrell ) . however , in the article announcing the discovery of this asteroid ( `` mnras '' , 1866 ) , pogson explained that he selected the name in reference to rhea silvia , mother of romulus and remus . sylvia is very dark in color and probably made of primitive . the discovery of its moons made possible an accurate measurement of the asteroid 's mass and density . its density is very low ( around 1.2 times the density of water ) , indicating that the asteroid has a lot of empty spaces ; from 25 % to as much as 60 % of it may be empty space , depending on the details of what it 's made of . however , the mineralogy of the x-type asteroids is not known well enough to force this further . either way , this suggests a loose rubble pile ( an asteroid that has been broken up in a collision and pulled back together by gravity ) structure . sylvia is also a fairly fast rotator , turning about its axis every 5.18 hours ( giving an equatorial rotation speed of about 230 km/h or 145 mph ) . the short axis is the rotation axis . direct images indicate that sylvia 's pole points towards ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( +62.6° , 72.4° ) with only a 0.5° uncertainty , which gives it an axial tilt of around 29.1° . sylvia 's shape is very stretched .
