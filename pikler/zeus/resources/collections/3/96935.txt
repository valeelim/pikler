Black bread mold     the black bread mold , rhizopus , is a common type of fungus . it grows and reproduces the same way that most molds do . in asexual reproduction , the mold makes spores inside a `` sporangium '' . when the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold , the sporangium breaks open and lets the spores float out . in sexual reproduction its hyphae touch the hyphae of another `` rhizopus '' mycelium . when they fuse , they make round balls called `` zygospores '' . after some time , the zygospore makes another sporangium , which then makes spores . during this sexual process , genetic recombination takes place , as with all eukaryotes . the spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mold , and begin to grow . they very quickly start making `` hyphae '' , small tendrils that look like roots . hyphae are not roots , but part of the mycelium . the mycelium is the main part of the mold , and grows inside the bread . black bread mold grows fast when the temperature is higher than 15 degrees celsius and lower than 20c .
