Ceratosauria     ceratosaurs are a group of theropod dinosaurs . they are defined as `` all theropods sharing a more recent common ancestry with `` ceratosaurus '' than with birds '' . ceratosauria includes the upper jurassic to upper cretaceous theropods `` ceratosaurus '' , `` elaphrosaurus '' , and `` abelisaurus '' , found mainly in the southern hemisphere . the earlies known ceratosaur is from the middle jurassic of patagonia , `` eoabelisaurus '' . this predates the oldest `` certainly known '' known member of the lineage by more than 40 million years . the almost complete skeleton of `` eoabelisaurus '' shows the earliest evolutionary stages of the distinctive abelisaurid modification of the forelimb . originally , ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the upper triassic to lower jurassic `` coelophysis '' and `` dilophosaurus '' . this implied a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods . however , recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a natural group with other ceratosaurs , and so they are excluded from this group .
