Moon     the moon ( ) is earth 's satellite , and we usually see it in the night sky . other planets also have moons or `` natural satellites '' . our moon is about a quarter the size of the earth . because it is far away it looks small , about half a degree wide . the gravity on the moon is one-sixth of the earth 's gravity . it means that something will be six times lighter on the moon than on earth . the moon is a rocky and dusty place . the moon drifts away from earth at the rate of four centimetres each year . the moon being round , half of it is lit up by the sun . as it goes around ( or orbits ) the earth , sometimes the side that people on earth can see is all lit brightly . other times only a small part of the side we see is lit . this is because the moon does not send out its own light . people only see the parts that are being lit by sunlight . these different stages are called phases of the moon . it takes the moon about 29.53 days ( 29 days , 12 hours , 44 minutes ) to complete the cycle , from big and bright to small and dim and back to big and bright . the phase when the moon passes between the earth and sun is called the `` new moon '' . the next phase of the moon is called the `` waxing crescent '' , followed by the `` first quarter '' , `` waxing gibbous '' , then to a full moon . a full moon occurs when the moon and sun are on opposite sides of the earth . as the moon continues its orbit it becomes a `` waning gibbous '' , `` third quarter '' , `` waning crescent '' , and finally back to a new moon . people used the moon to measure time . a month is approximately equal in time to a lunar cycle .
