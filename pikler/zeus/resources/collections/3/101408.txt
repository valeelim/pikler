Nanotechnology     nanotechnology is a part of science and technology about the control of matter on the atomic and molecular scale - this means things that are about 100 nanometres or smaller . nanotechnology includes making products that use parts this small , such as electronic devices , catalysts , sensors , etc . to give you an idea of how small that is , there are more nanometres in an inch than there are inches in 400 miles . to give a international idea of how small that is , there are as many nanometres in a centimetre , as there are centimetres in 100 kilometres . nanotechnology brings together scientists and engineers from many different subjects , such as applied physics , materials science , interface and colloid science , device physics , chemistry , supramolecular chemistry ( which refers to the area of chemistry that focuses on the non-covalent bonding interactions of molecules ) , self-replicating machines and robotics , chemical engineering , mechanical engineering , biology , biological engineering , and electrical engineering .
