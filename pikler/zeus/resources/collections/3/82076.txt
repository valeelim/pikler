Computer memory     the computer memory is a temporary storage area . it holds the data and instructions that the central processing unit ( cpu ) needs . before a program can be run , the program is loaded from some storage medium into the memory . this allows the cpu direct access to the program . memory is a need for any computer . a computer is usually an electrical device , which understands only electricity on and electricity off . this is expressed by using two symbols – 0 and 1 – which are called binary digits or bits . numbers and text characters are represented as codes , which are made up of combinations of 0s and 1s . simple character codes are called ascii ( the american standard code for information interchange ) , and unicode . in ascii , eight bits – any combination of 0s and 1s – form one character or symbol . for example , the letter a is denoted by the code 01000001. the basic working unit of the computer 's memory is a group of eight bits , which is called a byte . the computer 's memory consists of many millions of bytes . to make it easier , the unit k ( for kilobytes ) can be used to express memory capacity . one k equals 1,024. for example , 64k bytes of memory is the same as 65,536 ( 1,024 × 64 = 65,536 ) bytes . for larger memory capacities , the units `` mega '' and `` giga '' can be used . one megabyte of computer memory usually means 1024 kilobytes , which is 1,048,576 bytes , whereas one gigabyte means 1024 megabytes , which is 1,073,741,824 bytes . the size of the memory address that the computer uses limits the number of bytes it can handle .
