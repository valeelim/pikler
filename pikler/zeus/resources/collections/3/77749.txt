Saberâ€“toothed cat     the sabertoothed cats or sabretooth cats are some of the best known and most popular extinct animals . they are among the most impressive carnivores that ever have lived . these cats had long canines and jaws which opened wider than modern cats . this suggests a different style of killing from modern felines . the sabre-tooth style of life evolved at least five times amongst carnivorous mammals . this is one of the best-known examples of convergent evolution . 1. creodonts , were the earliest sabre-tooths known . they lived in the eocene , and are in a different order from the feliformia . `` machaeroides '' and `` apataelurus '' are examples . 1. the nimravids were a basal group in the feliformia , lasting from the eocene to the later miocene epochs . `` hoplophoneus '' is an example . 1. the barbourofelidae is another family of feliforms which developed the sabre-tooth lifestyle . they flourished in the miocene . they are probably more closely related to the felids than the nimravids . 1. sparassodonts , such as `` thylacosmilus '' , were a metatherian group of mammals . they used to be called `` marsupial sabre-tooths '' , but they belong to a sister-group to the marsupials . miocene to pliocene .
