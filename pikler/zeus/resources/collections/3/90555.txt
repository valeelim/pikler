Visible spectrum     the visible spectrum ( or sometimes called the optical spectrum ) is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye . electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light . a typical human eye will react to wavelengths in air from about 380 to 750 nm . the familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only , the `` pure spectral '' or `` monochromatic '' colors . but there are no clear boundaries between one color and the next . color displays ( e.g. , computer monitors or televisions ) mix red , green , and blue color to approximate the color spectrum . in the illustration , the narrow red , green and blue bars show the relative mixture of these three colors used to produce the color directly above .
