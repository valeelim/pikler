Supreme court     a supreme court is generally the highest court in a country . this means that , in many countries , it is the court of last resort and it has more power than other courts . decisions of lower appellate courts can be overruled here . however , not all highest courts are named as such . civil law countries do not tend to have only one high court . additionally , the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the `` supreme court '' . for example , the high court of australia . in some places the court named the `` supreme court '' is not the highest court . examples include the new york supreme court , the supreme courts of several provinces and territories of canada and the former supreme court of judicature of england and wales . decisions made in these courts are all subject to higher courts of appeal . some countries have a separate constitutional court . this is a high court that deals with issues regarding that country 's constitution . other countries do not have separate constitutional courts . constitutional issues are decided by their supreme court . nonetheless , such courts are sometimes also called `` constitutional courts '' . for example , some have called the supreme court of the united states `` the world 's oldest constitutional court '' because it was the first court in the world to strike down a law as unconstitutional . the case was `` marbury v. madison '' , 5 u.s. 137 ( 1803 ) . marbury v. madison also established the us supreme court as an equal branch of the united states government , along with the executive and legislative branches . the us supreme court is technically not a constitutional court just as the european court of justice is also not a constitutional court . however , both courts engage in a great deal of constitutional review . this means they function like a constitutional court , but are not called constitutional courts .
