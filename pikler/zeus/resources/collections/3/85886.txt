Static RAM     static random access memory ( sram ) is a type of ram that keeps data that 's fed to it without having to be refreshed over and over again . both dram and sram store information in binary by using very small electronic components . both are volatile ( need electrical current flowing to keep the negative and positive charged components stay that way ) . one difference is that sram are also used for specific applications within the pc , where their good points outweigh their bad points compared to dram . like other semiconductor chips , sram chips are made by photolithography . for sram , each bit is composed of between four and six transistors , the parts that hold information , which is why sram takes up much more space compared to dram . to compare with sram , dram has only one transistor plus a capacitor acting like a miniature rechargeable battery ) . good differences . - sram does not need to be refreshed . - changing static ram is faster than dram . bad differences . - sram is more expensive than dram .
