Nestorianism     nestorianism is a movement within christianity . the idea behind the doctrine was that there were two different persons of jesus . one of them was the man jesus , the other was the aspect of `` son of god '' , or logos . perhaps the most prominent supporter of the idea was nestorius , archbishop of constantinople . nestorius lived from about 380 to about 450 ad . the council of ephesus condemned this view in 431. this led to a split of the church , into the assyrian church of the east and the byzantine church . for this reason , the assyrian church of the east is sometimes called `` nestorian '' . the church holds the view that chist has two `` essences '' ( `` qnome '' ) that are united in one person ( `` parsopa '' ) . the only two churches that teach nestorianism today are the assyrian church of the east , and the church of the east & abroad .
