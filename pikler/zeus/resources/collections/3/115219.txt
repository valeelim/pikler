Hugo de Vries     hugo marie de vries ( haarlem , 16 february 1848 – lunteren , 21 may 1935 ) was a dutch botanist and one of the first geneticists . he suggested the concept of genes , rediscovered gregor mendel 's laws of heredity , and introduced the term `` mutation '' . he developed a mistaken mutation theory of evolution , mainly due to the peculiarities of his favourite organism , the evening primrose ( `` oenothera lamarckiana '' ) . carl correns also – independently – rediscovered gregor mendel 's work on genetics . erich von tschermak 's status as a third rediscoverer is now less convincing .
