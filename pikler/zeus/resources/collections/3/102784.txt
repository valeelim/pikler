Metcard     a metcard is a type of ticket used to use public transport in melbourne , australia . it allows the holder to use trains , trams and buses , in two zones ( zone 1 and zone 2 ) . zone 1 covers areas close to the cbd , and zone 2 covers the rest of the city . there used to be a zone 3 , but that has been merged with zone 2. the ticket is about the size of a credit card , and contains a magnitic strip that tells a computer what type of ticket it is . metcard replaced a identical yet simpler system of scratchies used on the melbourne public transport network . scratchies were easy to cheat and the system was eventually abandoned in 2002 , but not before tickets for many years of use were printed . moves towards automated ticketing were first made by the then state liberal government in 1992. tenders were called for the design , supply , installation and on-going maintenance of such a system , with the 'onelink transit consortium ' announced as the preferred people to do it in september 1993. the contract was signed in may 1994 , with the major technology supplier being the erg group .
