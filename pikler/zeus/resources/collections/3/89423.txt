Opera     opera is a drama set to music . an opera is like a play in which everything is sung instead of spoken . operas are usually performed in opera houses . the singers who sing and act out the story are on the stage , and the orchestra is in front of the stage but lower down , in the orchestra pit , so that the audience can see the stage . an opera is normally divided into two , three , four or even five acts . in older operas the music was mostly recitative and arias . during the recitative things would happen in the story . the aria was a song for a solo singer , a setting of a lyric . as well as recitative and aria there would be choruses . the chorus were a group of singers who sing in the crowd scenes . the opera would start with an overture for the orchestra . the overture would usually include tunes that are going to be heard later in the opera . in operas from the 19th century onwards there is often little or no difference between recitative and aria . composers like wagner wanted to get away from operas which had lots of separate arias in which the singers showed off , with the audience clapping loudly after each one . he wanted continuous music so that the mood would not be broken .
