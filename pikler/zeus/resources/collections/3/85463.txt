Sergeant     sergeant is a rank used in most militaries , policeforces , and other uniformed organizations around the world . the word comes from the latin `` serviens '' , `` one who serves '' , through the french term `` sergent '' . a sergeant ( sgt ) in the british army wears three point-down chevrons , or `` checks '' on their sleeve . they usually serves as a platoon , troop , or group sergeant , or in a specialist position . a lance-sergeant ( lsgt ) was originally a corporal doing the work of a sergeant . the job is now used mostly in the guards , where it is given to all corporals . a lance-sergeant in the guards and honourable artillery company wears three chevrons , and is considered senior or higher up to `` normal '' corporals . for most purposes , he still remains a corporal rather than an acting sergeant ( e.g. , he will typically command a section ) . in the household cavalry , the same rank is lance-corporal of horse . the official spelling was serjeant ( sjt ) ( still used by the rifles ) until after world war ii , although the modern spelling had already been in common use for many years .
