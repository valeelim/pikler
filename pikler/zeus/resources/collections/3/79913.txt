Reconnaissance     reconnaissance , sometimes called scouting , is the act of exploring to gain military information . often referred to as `` recce '' ( uk , canada and australia , ) or `` recon '' ( u.s. , ) , the associated formal verb is `` reconnoitre '' ( british spelling ) or `` reconnoiter '' ( american spelling ) . in informal english , both `` recce '' and `` recon '' are often also used as a verb . the term is sometimes used in non military contexts . often , units sent out for reconnaissance are armed only for self-defense . they rely on stealth to gather information . others are well-enough armed to also deny information to the enemy by fighting and or destroying their reconnaissance parties . `` reconnaissance-in-force '' ( rif ) is a method of probing an enemy 's position . an attack , even with a small force , may get a strong reaction by the enemy . hopefully that reveals the enemy 's strength , deployment , and other tactical information . the rif commander can fall back with the information or expand the conflict into a full engagement . other methods consist of hit-and-run tactics using moving very fast . in some cases light-armored vehicles are used for added fire superiority , as the need arises .
