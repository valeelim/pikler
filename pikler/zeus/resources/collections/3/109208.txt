Pattern matching     pattern matching is a family of tools for finding similar objects in different sources . in image processing , the pattern matching is used for locating a small image ( called model ) in a bigger one ( called target image ) . for searching text , regular expressions are commonly used . the simple way is to move the model in the target image and measure a similarity in each position . the position with highest value of the similarity will be accepted as result . the normalized correlation is used as a common metric for similarity . the common way to reduce an amount of calculations is using the image pyramid . when using the image pyramid , the search is started on the reduced target image , and results are improved in the next , more detailed one . this process is similar to the human vision .
