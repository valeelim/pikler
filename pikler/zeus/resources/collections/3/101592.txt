Polygamy     polygamy is a word that comes from late greek . it can be translated as `` many marriages '' . it refers to any form of marriage where a person has `` more than one spouse '' . there is also a concept called group marriage . in group marriage , all the ( adult ) members of the group are responsible for all the children . a man being married to more than one woman at the same time is called polygyny . a woman being married to more than one man at the same time is called polyandry . both forms have occurred in humans . polygyny is much more common , and is practised by millions of people , mostly in muslim countries , where a man can have up to four wives at the same time . in most non-muslim countries , polygamy is illegal , and a person who has more than one spouse can be prosecuted for bigamy . some countries , including india , only permit muslims to be polygamous . polygamy is one of the beliefs of mormon fundamentalists . these are mormons ( members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ) who strictly follow the teachings of joseph smith . smith felt it was his job to restore plural marriage to the earth . he was married to 33 women . in 1890 the mormon church officially stopped `` celestial marriages '' ( polygamy ) . church members who continue to practice plural marriage are excommunicated from the church .
