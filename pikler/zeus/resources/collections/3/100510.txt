Tempera     tempera ( sometimes known as `` egg tempera '' ) is a type of artist 's paint . it was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the byzantine world and the middle ages in europe , until it was replaced by oil painting as the most popular medium for large paintings . it is still used for orthodox icons . some modern painters use tempera . in modern times , some manufacturers call ordinary poster paint by the name of `` tempera '' . poster paint is not really tempera . it is a different type of paint called gouache . egg yolk ( the yellow part of the egg ) dries and sticks very firmly . it is used to mix and set the paints in a tempera painting . the colours are ground up into dry powders that must be mixed by the artist . in earlier times , some of the paints were very poisonous and the artist had to be careful not to breathe in the powdered paint . the paints are generally mixed with equal parts of egg yolk and water . if there is too much egg , the paint is gooey . if there is too much water , it is runny . neither of these things are good . some artists like to mix some of the egg white as well , for a different effect . sometimes some oil is added . in ancient times other things were added which might include honey , milk and plant gums .
