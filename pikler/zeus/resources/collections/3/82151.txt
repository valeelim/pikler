8 Flora     8 flora is a big , bright , main belt asteroid . it is the closest `` big '' asteroid : no asteroid closer to the sun has a diameter above 25 kilometres or two-elevenths that of flora itself , and not until the tiny 149 medusa was found was a single asteroid orbiting at a closer mean distance known . it is the seventh brightest asteroid with a mean opposition magnitude of +8.7 . flora can reach a magnitude of +7.9 at a favorable opposition near perihelion , such as will occur in mid november 2007. flora was found by j. r. hind on october 18 , 1847. it was his second asteroid discovery after 7 iris . the name flora was proposed by john herschel , from flora , the latin goddess of flowers and gardens , wife of zephyrus ( the personnification of the west wind ) , mother of spring , and whose greek equivalent is chloris ( who has her own asteroid , 410 chloris ) . flora is the parent body of the flora family of asteroids , and by far the biggest member , having about 80 % of the total mass of this family . but flora was almost certainly disrupted by the impact ( s ) that formed the family , and is probably an aggregate of most of the pieces .
