Glossolalia     glossolalia , or speaking in tongues , is speaking rapid speech-like syllables which can not be understood . in some cases it is part of religious practice . some consider it as a part of a sacred language . it is a common practice amongst pentecostal and charismatic christianity . in 1972 a linguist from the university of toronto published an assessment of pentecostal glossolalia . his assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private christian meetings in italy , the netherlands , jamaica , canada and the us . samarin found that glossolalic speech is like human language in some respects . the speaker uses accent , rhythm , intonation and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units . each unit is itself made up of syllables . the syllables are formed from consonants and vowels taken from a language known to the speaker : it is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels ... in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically ... with variations in pitch , volume , speed and intensity .
