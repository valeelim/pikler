20 Massalia     20 massalia is a big and fairly bright main belt asteroid . it is also the biggest member of the massalia family of asteroids . massalia is an s-type asteroid . it orbits at very low inclination in the intermediate main belt , and is by far the biggest asteroid in the massalia family . the remaining family members are pieces blown off by a cratering event on massalia massalia has an above-average density for s-type asteroids , similar to the density of silicate rocks . as such , it appears to be a solid un-fractured body , which is rare among asteroids of its size . apart from the few biggest bodies over 400 km in diameter , such as 1 ceres and 4 vesta , most asteroids appear to have been fractured a lot . lightcurve analysis indicates that massalia 's pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( 45° , 10° ) or ( β , λ ) = ( 45° , 190° ) with a 10° uncertainty . this gives an axial tilt of 45°in both cases . the shape reconstruction from lightcurves has been described as quite spherical with large planar , nonconvex parts of the surface .
