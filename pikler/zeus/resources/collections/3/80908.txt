Lift Coefficient     the lift coefficient ( `` c '' or `` c '' ) is coefficient without a dimension that relates the lift generated by an airfoil , the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around the airfoil , and the planform area of the airfoil . it may also be described as the ratio of lift pressure to dynamic pressure . - lift coefficient may be used to relate the total lift generated by an aircraft to the total area of the wing of the aircraft . - lift coefficent may also be used as a characteristic of a particular shape ( or cross-section ) of an airfoil . the lift coefficient is a dimensionless number .
