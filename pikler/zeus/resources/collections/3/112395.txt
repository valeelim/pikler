Luca Marenzio     luca marenzio ( born coccaglio , near brescia , italy , 18 october ? 1553 ? ; died rome , 22 august 1599 ) was an italian composer who lived in the late renaissance . he was one of the best known composers of madrigals . marenzio may have been born in 1553. we think this because his father once wrote down his son ’ s age . the date may have been 18 october because that was his saint ’ s feast day . he had his early education in brescia possibly in mantua . then he moved to rome , where he worked as a singer for cardinal cristoforo madruzzo . after the cardinal 's death he worked at the court of cardinal luigi d'este . here he started to become known as a composer . by 1581 his music had become extremely popular . his books of madrigals were often reprinted . his madrigals were often included in published collections . in 1587 he moved to florence where he worked for ferdinando i de ' medici for two years ; in 1589 he returned to rome , where he spent most of his last years , except for a trip to poland from 1596 to 1597 , during which time he worked at the court of sigismund iii vasa in warsaw . it seems from what some people wrote that his trip to poland ruined his health , and he died in rome in 1599 , shortly after returning from poland .
