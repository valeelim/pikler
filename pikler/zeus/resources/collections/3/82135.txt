5 Astraea     5 astraea ( written astræa in the early literature ) is a big main belt asteroid . its surface is very reflective ( bright ) and what it 's made of is probably a mixture of nickel-iron with magnesium- and iron-silicates . the adjectival form of the name , although unused , would be `` astraean '' ( which also designates a genus of star corals ) . astraea was the fifth asteroid found , on december 8 , 1845 by k. l. hencke . it was his first of two asteroid discoveries . the second was 6 hebe . an amateur astronomer and post office employee , hencke was looking for 4 vesta when he stumbled on astraea . the king of prussia awarded him with an annual pension of 300 us $ ( 1968 dollars ) for the discovery . photometry indicates prograde rotation , that the north pole points in the direction of right ascension 9 h 52 min , declination 73° with a 5° uncertainty . this gives an axial tilt of about 33° . astrea is physically unremarkable but notable mainly because for 38 years ( after the discovery of vesta in 1807 ) it had been thought that there were only four asteroids . in terms of maximum brightness , it is indeed only the `` seventeenth brightest '' main belt asteroid , being fainter than 192 nausikaa and even , at rare near-perihelion oppositions , the highly eccentric carbonaceous 324 bamberga .
