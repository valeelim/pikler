Pinhole camera     a pinhole camera is a camera without a conventional glass lens . an extremely small hole in a thin material can create an image when all light rays from a scene go through a single point . in order to produce a reasonably clear image , the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen , or less . the shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light-proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole . a common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time . this type of photography is called solargraphy . pinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture ; typical exposure times can range from 5 seconds to hours or days . the image may be projected on a translucent screen for real-time viewing ( popular for viewing solar eclipses ; see also camera obscura ) . very early in history ( as far back as 500 b.c . ) , greeks such as aristotle and euclid wrote on naturally-occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras , for example light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets and the crossing of leaves the ancient greeks , however , believed that our eye emitted rays which enabled us to see . what enabled a much better understanding of the pinhole camera was the discovery that light enters the eye rather than leaving it . it was the 10th-century muslim mathematician , astronomer and physicist ibn al-haytham who published this idea .
