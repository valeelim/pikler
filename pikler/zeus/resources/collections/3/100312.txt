Transport Layer Security     transport layer security ( tls ) protocol and its predecessor , secure sockets layer ( ssl ) , are cryptographic protocols that provide security and data integrity for communications over tcp/ip networks such as the internet . several versions of the protocols are common in applications such as web browsing , electronic mail , internet faxing , instant messaging and voice-over-ip ( voip ) . the tls protocol allows applications to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping , tampering , and message forgery . tls provides endpoint authentication and communications confidentiality over the internet using cryptography . most of the time , only the server is authenticated ( `` i.e . `` , its identity is ensured ) while the client remains unauthenticated ; this means that the end user ( whether an individual or an application , such as a web browser ) can be sure with whom it is communicating . the next level of security is known as mutual authentication . mutual authentication requires public key infrastructure ( pki ) deployment to clients unless tls-psk or the secure remote password ( srp ) protocol are used , which provide strong mutual authentication without needing to deploy a pki .
