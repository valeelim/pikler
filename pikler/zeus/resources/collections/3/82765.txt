29 Amphitrite     29 amphitrite is one of the biggest s-type asteroids , probably third in diameter after eunomia and juno , although iris and herculina are similar in size . it is probably not a fully solid body , since its density is too low for a solid silicate object and much lower than eunomia or juno . its orbit is less eccentric and inclined than those of its bigger cousins - being indeed the most circular of any asteroid found up to that point - and as a consequence it never becomes as bright as iris or hebe , especially as it is much farther from the sun than those asteroids . it can reach magnitudes of around +8.6 at a favorable opposition , but more usually is around the binocular limit of +9.5 . amphitrite was found by albert marth on march 1 , 1854. it was the only asteroid he found . it is named after amphitrite , a sea goddess in greek mythology . a moon is suspected based on the lightcurve data . other websites . - orbital simulation from jpl ( java ) / ephemeris
