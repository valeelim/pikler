Allemande     an allemande ( ) is a dance that was popular in baroque music of the 17th and early 18th centuries . the word comes from the french word for `` german '' . composers of the baroque period often wrote a group of dances called a suite . there was usually an allemande , a courante , a sarabande and a gigue , in that order . sometimes there were one or two other dances as well . sometimes a suite started with a prelude ( an introductory movement ) before the allemande . the allemande was played at a moderate speed - not very fast , nor very slow . there were usually 4 beats in a bar ( 4/4 time ) but also sometimes in 2/2 time , and it started with an anacrusis ( an upbeat , i.e . one , or possibly a small group of notes which were not on the first beat of a bar ) .
