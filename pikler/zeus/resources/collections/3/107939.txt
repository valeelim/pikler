Tikal     tikal ( or tik â€™ al , according to modern orthography ) is the largest of the ancient ruined cities of the maya civilization . it lies in modern day guatemala at . now it is a unesco world heritage site , and a popular tourist spot . tikal was one of the major cultural and population centers of the maya civilization . the oldest monumental architecture at the site dates to the 4th century bc . the best time of tikal was during the classic period , from 200 ad to 900 ad . in this period , tikal was in charge of the maya region politically , economically , and militarily . this is because it was linked with areas throughout mesoamerica , such as central mexican , the center of teotihuacan . after the end of the late classic period , no new major monuments were built . some palaces were burned and the population declined . the site was abandoned by the end of the 10th century . the ruins are on lowland rainforest , but tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored underground . archaeologists working in tikal during the last century used the underground facilities to store water for their own use . the absence of springs , rivers , and lakes nearby is unusual for a major city . however , tikal did well with agricultural techniques . these were more advanced than the slash & burn methods originally theorized by archeologists . the reliance on seasonal rainfall made tikal open to drought . this is now thought to play a major part in the `` classic maya collapse '' .
