Microbiotheria     microbiotheria are a small order of marsupial mammals with only one living species , the monito del monte ( spanish for 'little mountain monkey ' ) . it is the only new world representative of the superorder australidelphia ; all other new world marsupials are part of the ameridelphia . the species is nocturnal and arboreal , and lives in thickets of chilean bamboo in the temperate rain forests of the southern andes . it eats mainly insects and other small invertebrates , supplemented with fruit . at one time , they were placed in the order didelphimorphia , the opossums , but due to many morphological differences , they were placed in another order . the skull 's shape is strange , with many technical differences from the opossums . it has long been suspected that south american marsupials were ancestral to those of australia . the two continents were connected via antarctica in the early cainozoic era . australia â€™ s earliest known marsupial is `` djarthia '' , a primitive mouse-like animal that lived about 55 million years ago . `` djarthia '' had been identified as the earliest known australidelphian , and this research suggested that the monito del monte was the last of a clade which included `` djarthia '' .
