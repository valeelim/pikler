Child soldier     a child soldier is a child that takes part to actively fight in a war . there is no official definition . the coalition to stop the use of child soldiers says that no one less than 18 years old should be recruited by regular or auxiliary troops . the age limit of 18 years is taken from the convention on the rights of the child . unicef , terre des hommes and amnesty international see all the combatants and their helpers that are below 18 years of age as `` child soldiers '' . there is a problem , however . if such children were classified as combatants , this would permit to fight against children in wars . on the other hand , if such children were captured , they would then have to be treated according to the geneva conventions as `` prisoners of war '' . the rome statute of the international criminal court says that recruiting people below the age of 15 is a war crime , and must be prosecuted . thomas lubanga is currently being tried for this crime at the court in den haag . according to an un source , 300.000 children were actively participating in armed conflicts , in 1996 .
