Hurricane Erika (2003)    hurricane erika ( 2003 ) hurricane erika was a atlantic hurricane that hit extreme northeastern mexico near the texas-tamaulipas border . it happened on august 16 , during the 2003 atlantic hurricane season . erika was the eighth tropical cyclone , fifth tropical storm , and third hurricane of the season that year . the storm was created from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern gulf of mexico on august 14. under the influence of a high pressure system , erika moved quickly westward and became stronger under favorable conditions . a weak surface area of low pressure came apart from a frontal system on august 8. it was moving southwestward during that time . on august 9 , it created convection when it was passing underneath a cold-core upper-level low . as the system rapidly continued westward , a lot of the convection stayed near the center of the upper-level low , preventing development of a closed surface circulation . on august 13 , while located near the northwestern bahamas , an increase in convection made the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere , which caused the development of an upper level anticyclone .
