Loggerhead sea turtle     the loggerhead sea turtle or loggerhead , ( `` caretta caretta '' ) , is a type of turtle that lives in the sea . it is from the family cheloniidae . loggerheads live in the seas around the world . most of the beaches where loggerheads lay eggs are found on the coasts of the united states in north america ( mostly in florida ) , oman in asia , and australia in the pacific ocean . some loggerheads also live near other countries like chile , greece , and indonesia . loggerheads eat fish , squid , jellyfish , crabs , and other small sea animals . loggerheads mate while they are moving in the seas mostly from march to june every 2 or 3 years . when they are ready to lay eggs female loggerheads always come back to the same beach where they came out of their eggs as babies . most loggerheads lay eggs in june and july . most lay between 100 and 126 eggs . the eggs look much like ping-pong balls . when they come out of the eggs baby loggerheads are called `` hatchlings '' . they usually come out at night so that other animals , like birds and crabs , do not eat them . the hatchlings follow light from the morning sun to the sea . they swim out to parts of the ocean that have seaweed ( plants that grow in the sea ) to hide from other animals while they grow .
