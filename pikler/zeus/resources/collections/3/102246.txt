Book of Joshua     the book of joshua is the sixth book of the christian bible , and also the sixth book of the hebrew tanakh . it is clear who wrote the book , because most of the jewish tradition believe it was joshua , son of nun . it is the first of the books of the tanakh ( old testament ) covering the history of israel from the arrival in the promised land to the babylonian captivity . it is thought that the book was written around the 15th century b.c . after the death of moses , god put joshua in charge of the people . joshua sent two spies to spy on the city of jericho . a women hid these two men and said they had already left . she hid them on top of her roof , underneath stalks of flax . the spies later promised that they would keep the oath that joshua made with them . jericho fell when the people of israel , instructed by god , circled around the wall of jericho seven times and blew their ram 's horns , and on the seventh time , they all shouted with a great shout , causing the wall to fall . joshua told the spies to go to rahab 's house and bring out her family and belongings . the spies did as they were told , as they kept the oath . joshua saved rahab 's life , and she went to live in israel .
