Themis (hypothetical moon)    themis ( hypothetical moon ) on april 28 , 1905 , the american astronomer william h. pickering said that he had found a tenth moon of the planet saturn . pickering named the moon themis . no other astronomer has ever seen the moon that pickering said he saw . because of this , astronomers do not count themis as an official moon of saturn . pickering tried to figure out an orbit for themis . he thought that themis had an inclination of 39.1Â° to the ecliptic , with 0.23 eccentricity ( 0.23 ) and a semi-major axis distance of 1,457,000 km . this meant that themis had an orbit like the moons titan and hyperion . pickering believed that it took themis 20.85 days to orbit saturn , in a prograde motion . pickering thought that the diameter of themis was about 38 miles ( 61 km ) . pickering had also discovered the moon phoebe , but modern astronomers know that pickering made a mistake when he gave 42 miles ( 68 km ) as the diameter of phoebe . because astronomers know how pickering made his mistake , they can say that if themis existed , it would have a diameter of 200 km .
