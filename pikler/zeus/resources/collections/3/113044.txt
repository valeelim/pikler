Rajouri District     rajouri ( ) is a district in jammu and kashmir , kashmir , pakistan . since it borders the republic of india 's side of the line of control , it is the site of infiltration and militant activity . rajouri is also notable for the presence of many gujjar and bakerwal villages , particularly towards the pir panjal mountain range . the district has 7 tehsils ( towns ) namely rajouri tehsil , darhal tehsil , nowshera tehsil , sunderbani tehsil , kalakote tehsil , budhal tehsil and thannamandi tehsil and 7 blocks of rajouri , manjakote , darhal , budhal , kalakote , sunderbani and nowshera . there is diversity in the religious practices of the residents of these various towns with some being predominantly hindu and others with muslim majorities . the presence of militancy has affected the composition in most muslim majority regions that are closer to the border . in overall , per official 1981 estimates , the population as divided by religion is 58 % muslim , 39 % hindu , 2 % sikh and 1 % buddhist . this composition has since likely changed dramatically due to militancy having forced substantial minority communities to the hindu dominated districts near jammu .
