Lightning rod     a lightning rod or lightning conductor is a iron rod that is used to make lightning strike it , rather than strike something else . it is part of a lightning protection system . such a system is made of many such rods . these rods are usually placed at high points of buildings and structures . in addition , paths are made the electricity can take from the rooftop to the ground . lightning can damage structures made of most materials ( masonry , wood , concrete and even steel ) . the huge currents involved can heat materials , and especially water to high temperatures . this will cause fire , loss of strength and explosions from superheated steam and air . the church tower was usually the highest structure or building in medieval european towns and villages . it was also the building very often hit by lightning . early on , christian churches tried to prevent the damage of lightning by prayers . priests prayed , peter ahlwardts ( `` reasonable and theological considerations about thunder and lightning '' , 1745 ) said people who sought to protect themselves from lightning should go anywhere except in or around a church .
