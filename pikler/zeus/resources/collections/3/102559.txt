Living fossil     living fossil refers to life forms which have survived with little change for a long time , and which are still around today . - horseshoe crabs are a typical case of living fossil . they have changed little in appearance since the ordovician period , 450 million years ago . - crocodilians first appeared 220 million years ago , and are close relatives of the dinosaurs . however , modern crocodiles only date back to the upper cretaceous of 84 million years ago . - turtles are first known from 215 million years ago , but for some reason they are not often mentioned as living fossils . - the tuatara , from new zealand , is the sole survivor of a whole order of reptiles , the sphenodontia . 200 million years ago the group ( sister to the lizards and snakes ) was quite common . - the coelacanth is definitely a living fossil . it is the closest link between fish and the first amphibians ( 408362 million years ago ) . the coelacanth was thought to have been extinct for 80 million years until one was caught alive off the east african coast in 1938. it is therefore also a lazarus taxon .
