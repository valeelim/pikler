Recrystallisation     recrystallization ( see also crystallization ) is an essentially physical process that has meanings in chemistry , metallurgy and geology . in chemistry , recrystallization is a procedure for purifying compounds . a crystal compound often has other compounds on it that make it less useful . to get rid of these extra items , the crystal is placed in a boiling liquid . soon the crystal dissolves . the boiling solution , or the mix of the liquid and the dissolved crystal , gets colder . the crystal will form again . the unwanted compounds stay in the solvent , or the liquid . now the crystal is pure and made of only the compound . each type of compound works best in a certain type of liquid . sometimes two or more liquids mixed together are needed to dissolve a crystal . in geology , solid-state recrystallization is a metamorphic process that occurs under situations of intense temperature and pressure where grains , atoms or molecules of a rock or mineral are packed closer together , creating a new crystal structure .
