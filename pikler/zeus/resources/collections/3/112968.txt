Umayyad Caliphate     the umayyad caliphate was the second of the four major islamic caliphates established after the death of muhammad . it was the largest empire in the world at the time . it is the fifth largest empire in history . it was ruled by the umayyad dynasty ( , `` banu umayyah '' ) who came from mecca . damascus was the capital from 661–744 , harrran from 744–750 , and in exile their capital was córdoba ( 756–1031 ) . according to tradition , the umayyad family ( also known as the banu abd-shams ) and the islamic prophet muhammad both have a common ancestor , abd manaf ibn qusai . muhammad descended from abd munaf via his son hashim , the umayyads descended from abd munaf via a different son , abd-shams . the two families are therefore considered to be different clans ( those of hashim and of umayya , respectively ) of the same tribe ( that of the quraish ) . the umayyads and the hashimites were bitter rivals . the rivalry came from the initial opposition of abu sufyan ibn harb , the grandson of umayya , to muhammad and to islam . he tried to get rid of the new religion by waging a series of battles . but eventually he accepted islam , as did his son ( the future caliph muawiyah i ) , and the two provided much-needed political and diplomatic skills for the management of the quickly expanding islamic empire .
