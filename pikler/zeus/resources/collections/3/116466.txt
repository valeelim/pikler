Modern evolutionary synthesis     the modern evolutionary synthesis is about evolution . it explained how the discoveries of gregor mendel fit with charles darwin 's theory of evolution by means of natural selection . mendel found out how we inherit our genes . key biologists who contributed work to the synthesis included : julian huxley , theodosius dobzhansky , ernst mayr , ronald fisher , j.b.s . haldane , sewall wright , g.g . simpson , e.b . ford , bernhard rensch and g. ledyard stebbins . the modern synthesis brought darwin 's idea up to date . it bridged the gap between different types of biologists : geneticists , naturalists , and palaeontologists . it states that : 1. evolution can be explained by what we know about genetics , and what we see of animals and plants living in the wild . 1. the variety of genes ( alleles ) carried in natural populations is a key factor in evolution . 1. natural selection is the main mechanism of change . even a very slight advantage can be important , continued generation after generation . the struggle for existence of animals and plants in the wild causes natural selection . only those who survive and reproduce pass their genes on to the next generation . we find the strength of natural selection in the wild was greater than even darwin expected .
