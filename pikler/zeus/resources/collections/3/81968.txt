Titania (moon)    titania ( moon ) titania is the biggest moon of uranus and the eighth biggest moon in the solar system . titania was found on january 11 , 1787 by william herschel . he reported it and oberon the same year . he later reported four more moons , which turned out to be spurious . the names of titania and the other four moons of uranus then known were suggested by herschel 's son john herschel in 1852 at the request of william lassell , who had found ariel and umbriel the year before . lassell had earlier supported herschel 's 1847 naming scheme for the seven then-known moons of saturn and had named his newly-found eighth moon hyperion in accordance with herschel 's naming scheme in 1848. all of the moons of uranus are named for characters from shakespeare or alexander pope . titania was named after titania , the queen of the faeries in `` a midsummer night 's dream '' . shakespeare 's character 's name is pronounced , but the moon is often pronounced , by analogy with the familiar chemical element titanium . it is also designated uranus iii .
