Denial of the Armenian Genocide     denial of the armenian genocide is saying that the armenian genocide did not happen or what happened was not genocide . from 1915-1917 , in the ottoman empire , the ottoman government tried to get rid of some armenian people in the empire . the government did this by killing between 800,000 and 1,500,000 armenian people . they also made many armenians leave their homes ( this is called relocation ) . people who deny the armenian genocide say that these things partially or never happened . they also say that the ottoman government never , in an organized way , tried to commit genocide against the armenian people . for example , the united states of america and republic of turkey does not accept that the ottoman government tried to get rid of all the armenian people in the empire . in 1990 , psychologist robert jay lifton got a letter from the turkish ambassador to the united states . in the letter , the ambassador asked lifton how he could have talked about the armenian genocide in one of his books ( because the ambassador believed the genocide never happened ) . by mistake , the ambassador also included a draft of a letter written by scholar heath lowry , which told him how to keep the armenian genocide from being talked about in books . lowry was later named to a chair ( an important position ) at princeton university . princeton had been given a $ 750,000 grant from the republic of turkey . this brought up many arguments about ethics in scholarship .
