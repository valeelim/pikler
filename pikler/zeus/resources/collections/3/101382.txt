History of Asia     the history of asia can be seen as the history of several distinct regions , east asia , south asia , and the middle east that have more or less context depending of the situation in the central eurasian steppe . the coastal periphery was the home to some of the world 's earliest known civilizations , with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys . the civilizations in mesopotamia , the indus valley , and china had much in common . therefore it is likely that they exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel . other aspects such as that of writing developed individually in each area . cities , states and then empires developed in these lowlands . the steppe region had long been inhabited by nomads , and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the asian continent . the earliest known expansion out of the steppe is that of the indo-europeans which spread their languages into the middle east , india , and in the tocharians to the borders of china . the northern part of the continent was not accessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the tundra . these areas had very few people .
