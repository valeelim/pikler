West Pakistan     the province of west pakistan was created on 14 october 1955 by the merger of the provinces , states and tribal areas of the western wing . the province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at lahore . the province of east bengal was renamed east pakistan with the provincial capital at dacca . the federal government moved in 1959 from karachi to rawalpindi ( provisional capital until islamabad was finished ) , whilst the federal legislature moved to dacca . west pakistan formed a block whose people seemed homogeneous ( similar to each other ) . however , the new region included people of different ethnicities and languages . the `` one unit policy '' was regarded as a rational administrative reform which would reduce spending and eliminate provincial prejudices . however with the military coup of 1958 , trouble loomed for the province when the office of chief minister was abolished and the president took over executive powers for west pakistan . the province of west pakistan was dissolved in july 1970 by president yahya khan .
