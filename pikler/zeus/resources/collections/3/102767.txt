Druidism     druidism or druidry ( referred to as neodruidry or neodruidism by some followers ) is a form of modern spirituality that generally promotes harmony with nature , often through the form of nature worship . it is considered to be a neopagan faith . originally inspired by 17th , 18th and 19th century romantic movements , early neo-druidism was based upon largely historically incorrect depictions of the iron age celtic druids , and has no direct relation to the ancient celts or their culture . neo-druidic beliefs vary wildly , and there is no set dogma or belief system by which all adherents follow . the main belief is an idea that the earth and nature is sacred , and is worthy of worship itself . for this reason many druids are pantheistic . related pages . - celts - druid - stonehenge
