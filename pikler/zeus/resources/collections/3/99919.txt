S/2004 S 4     even though astronomers tried to find it again , it has not been reliably seen since . notably , an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 november , 2004 failed to find the object . this suggests that it was a clump of material that had disappeared by that time . an interpretation where s3 and s4 are or were a single object on a f-ring crossing orbit is also possible . such an object might also be orbiting at a bit different inclination to the f ring , thereby not actually passing through the ring material even though it was being seen both radially inward and outward of it . if a solid object after all , would be 3âˆ’5 km in diameter based on brightness .
