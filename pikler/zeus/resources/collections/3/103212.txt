Rosenhan experiment     the rosenhan experiment is a test in psychiatry . it wants to see how good a psychiatric diagnosis really is . the first person to do the test was david rosenhan . the test is named after him . it was first conducted in 1972. rosenhan published the results in the journal `` science '' under the title `` on being sane in insane places . '' the test is made of two parts . in the first part , psychiatrically sane people said they heard hallucinations , to get admitted to a psychiatric ward . this was done to test how the psychiatric hospitals would react . the second part was the reverse . rosahan told the hospitals , he would send `` fake patients '' . but he did not send any `` fake '' patients . the results of the study were very controversial . when rosenhan sent the people , the hospitals was unable to detect them . on the other hand , when he told them he had sent some patients , but really did not , the hospitals recognised a large number of `` fake patients '' . the study said that it was impossible to tell a difference between the sane and the insane .
