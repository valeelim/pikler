Humberside     humberside was a non-metropolitan county of england . it existed from 1 april 1974 until 31 march 1996. it was not popular , because the north and south banks of the river humber used to be in different counties , and there were no links between the two . even the building of the humber bridge , the longest bridge in europe at the time , did not encourage the two sides of the river to mix .
