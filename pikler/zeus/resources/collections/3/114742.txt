Objectivism (Ayn Rand)    objectivism ( ayn rand ) objectivism is a philosophy that was started by ayn rand . it has four main ideas : 1. everything that exists has an identity . this identity does not depend on how people think about it or talk about it . this is also true for things like feelings or ideas . it says that a thing is the thing which it is , or `` a is a . '' what people learn about the things that exist comes both from the identity of the things themselves and from the way that people observe ( see ) and think about what they have observed . 2. reason is how a person knows that what he thinks or believes is true . a person can not make something true just by wanting it to be true or by mysticism . only rational , logical thinking can produce the best outcome . this means recognizing that a thing is the thing it is , and to not confuse it with things which it is not . 3. it is good to be happy , and it is good for a person to try to be happy . people should always try to improve their lives and be happy in the long term , so that they are happy now and in the future . people should not hurt others to try to be happy , but they also should not hurt themselves to try to make other people happy . people should also not make themselves less happy to help something like god . ayn rand called this `` rational self-interest '' .
