Tropical cyclone scales     tropical cyclones are ranked according to their maximum winds using several scales . these scales are provided by several bodies , including the world meteorological organization , the national hurricane center , and the bureau of meteorology . the national hurricane center uses the saffir-simpson hurricane scale for hurricanes in the eastern pacific and atlantic basins . australia uses a difference set of tropical cyclone categories for their region . many basins have different names for storms of hurricane/typhoon/cyclone strength . the use of different definitions for maximum sustained wind creates additional confusion into the definitions of cyclone categories worldwide .
