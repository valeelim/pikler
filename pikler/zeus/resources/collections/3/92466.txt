New Horizons     new horizons is a space probe launched by nasa on 19 january 2006 , to the dwarf planet pluto and on an escape trajectory from the sun . it is the first man-made spacecraft to go to pluto . its flight took eight years . it arrived at the pluto-charon system on july 14 , 2015. it flew near pluto and took photographs and measurements while it passed . at about 1 kilobit per second it took 15 months to transmit them back to earth . the primary mission of new horizons is to study pluto and its system of moons . the secondary mission is to study any objects in the kuiper belt , if something became available for a flyby . the space probe set the record for the fastest man-made object ever launched , with the earth-relative speed of about 16.26 km/s , although , arguably , the helios probes got a faster sun-relative speed . it used a gravity assist from jupiter to get its high speeds without having to burn as much monopropellant ( weak rocket fuel ) as needed to fly directly to pluto . in 2019 the probe is expected to flyby and study a small kuiper belt object . after that , it wo n't have enough propellant to go to another target . it will continue to report about its environment .
