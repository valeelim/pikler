John William Waterhouse     john william waterhouse ( 6 april 1849 â€“ 10 february 1917 ) was an english painter in the pre-raphaelite style . he worked after the breakup of the pre-raphaelite brotherhood , and so was called `` the modern pre-raphaelite '' . he was also influenced by his contemporaries , the impressionists . his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient greek mythology and arthurian legend . born in italy to english parents who were both painters , he later moved to london , where he enrolled in the royal academy of art . he soon began exhibiting at their annual summer exhibitions , focusing on the creation of large canvas works depicting scenes from the daily life and mythology of ancient greece . later on in his career he came to embrace the pre-raphaelite style of painting despite the fact that it had gone out of fashion in the british art scene several decades before . although not as well known as earlier pre-raphaelite artists such as dante rossetti , john millais and william holman hunt , waterhouse 's work is currently displayed at several major british art galleries , and the royal academy of art organised a major retrospective of his work in 2009 .
