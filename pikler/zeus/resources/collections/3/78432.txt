Palla     palla , italian language for ball , is the name of various traditional ball games of italy . in italian they also call `` pallacanestro '' for basketball , `` pallavolo '' for volleyball , `` pallamano '' for handball and `` pallanuoto '' for water polo . `` palla eh ! '' is an old tuscan ball game from maremma towns between siena and grosseto . it has this name because players call out `` eh ! '' before serving . small hand-made balls contain a lead wrapped in rubber and wool with a leather cover . the game is played by facing teams who strike , not catch , the ball with either a bare or gloved hand : every team include 3 , 4 or 5 athletes . courts are marked out with painted lines on town streets , but there is no net , and players can move between sides . adjacent buildings , objects , and sometimes spectators , are considered `` in play . '' play does stop for oncoming automobiles . similar to real tennis , a second bounce can result in a `` chase '' rather than an outright point , marked in chalk where the ball stops rolling . in one version of palla , scoring is identical to that of tennis : 15-30-40-game .
