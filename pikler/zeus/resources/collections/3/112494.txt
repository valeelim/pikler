Hexapoda     the subphylum hexapoda , meaning `` six legs '' , is the largest ( in terms of number of species ) group of arthropods and includes the insects as well as three much smaller groups of arthropods without wings : collembola , protura , and diplura . all of these were called insects before . they form a polyphyletic group because they evolved independently from each other . in other words , hexapoda is divided into the insects and the entognatha . `` hexapods '' are so called because they have a thorax with three pairs of legs . most other arthropods have more than three pairs of legs . alternatively , the hexapoda could be eliminated as polyphyletic ( which it is ) , the insecta promoted to sub-phylum , and the minor groups `` incertae sedis '' â€” a latin term meaning `` of uncertain placement '' . it is used for a taxonomic group when its broader relationships are unknown or undefined .
