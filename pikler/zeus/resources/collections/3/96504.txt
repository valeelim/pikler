Critical density     critical density is the value at which the universe is at balance , and expansion is stopped . this value is estimated as ( 1-3 ) ×10^-26 kg/m³ . this is related to the cosmic density parameter in many ways ; this term describes the ratio of the actual density value of the universe to the critical density value . if the ratio is one , then the universe is at balance , and the universe is flat . if the ratio is greater than one , then the actual density of the universe is greater than the critical density , and thus the universe will eventually become closed . if the ratio is less than one , then the actual density is less than the critical density , and the universe is open .
