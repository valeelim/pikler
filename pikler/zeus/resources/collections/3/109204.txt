Quetzalcoatl     quetzalcoatl ( pronounced : ketsalˈkoːaːtɬ in nahuatl ) is an aztec sky and creator god . the name is a combination of `` quetzalli '' , a brightly colored mesoamerican bird , and , which means serpent ; it is therefore usually translated as `` feathered serpent '' or `` plumed serpent '' . quetzalcoatl was often pictured as a snake with feathers , although he was sometimes shown in the form of a human . quetzalcoatl was associated with the planet venus , as well as being the patron god of the aztec priesthood , of learning and of knowledge . the name quetzalcoatl was also taken on by several ancient aztec leaders . many events and characteristics attributed to quetzalcoatl are therefore exceedingly difficult to separate from the political leaders who took his name . today quetzalcoatl is arguably the best known aztec deity but there were several other important aztec gods too : tlaloc , tezcatlipoca and huitzilopochtli . other mesoamerican cultures have worshipped a feathered serpent god as well : at teotihuacan the several monumental structures have images of a feathered serpent ( see the so-called `` citadel and temple of quetzalcoatl '' ) . one can see similar images at chichén itza and tula . this has led scholars to conclude that the deity called quetzalcoatl in the nahuatl language was among the most important deities of mesoamerica .
