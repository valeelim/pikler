Louisiana Purchase     the louisiana purchase was a land purchase made by united states president thomas jefferson in 1803. he bought the louisiana territory from france , which was being led by napoleon bonaparte at the time , for $ 15,000,000 usd . at first , the men sent to france were allowed to spend up to $ 10,000,000 usd in order to buy new orleans and , if possible , the west bank of the mississippi river . but then the french government said that for five million more dollars they would sell all of the louisiana territory . thomas jefferson approved the deal and used his constitutional power to sign treaties to buy the land . napoleon sold the land because he was desperate for money and he was afraid of losing his north american territories to the british . napoleon bonaparte had been busy with a war in europe , and no matter how badly that bonaparte wanted to go about in his interests with america , there was no way that he could do so with what he had been occupied in europe with . thomas jefferson took this as an opportunity to make america larger , even if it meant going against his republican principles of small government ( some would say he exceeded his constitutional power by accepting the deal on his own ) .
