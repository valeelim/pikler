Athanasian Creed     the athanasian creed is a christian statement of faith . it is also often referred to as quicumque vult ( can be translated as `` whoever wants '' , the first two words of the statement ) . it is the first known creed to talk about trinity . it has been in use since the 6th century , mainly in the western part of the church . it is not used very much today , the nicene creed has largely replaced it . from about the 9th century people thought that st. athanasius had written it . athanasus lived in the 4th century in egypt . today , this view is largely seen as false . this is because of the following : 1. the original text is in latin . athanasius wrote mainly in greek . 1. neither athanasius nor other people who lived at the same time as him mention it . 1. it talks about problems that were only discovered after athanasius ' death . today , most people think it came from gaul around the year 500. its positions are similar to those taken by st. ambrose of milan , augustine of hippo or vincent of lérins . j.n.d . kelly , a contemporary patristics scholar , believes that st. vincent of lérins was not its author , but suggests that it may have come from the same bacground , namely the area of lerins in southern gaul . caesarius of arles is one of the possible authors .
