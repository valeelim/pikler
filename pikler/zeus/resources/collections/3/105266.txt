Anguis fragilis     anguis fragilis ( the slow-worm , or blind worm ) is a lizard which is limbless ( meaning it has no legs or arms ) . it has a wide distribution in europe and asia , and is one of the few reptiles native to britain . when a slow-worm is in danger it can shed ( break off ) its tail and escape . it can then grow back a new , shorter tail , which it can not shed . the female often has a stripe along the back and the male may have blue spots . instead of laying eggs , the females give birth to live young ( viviparous birth ) . in the days leading up to birth the female can often be seen basking in the sun on a warm road . slow-worms are often called snakes , but they are not . slow-worms can blink , but snakes can not . they shed their skin in patches like other lizards , rather than the whole skin as most snakes do . adult slow-worms grow to be about 50 centimetres long . they are known for their very long life . one was said to have been fifty four years old . there are not as many slow-worms as there used to be . many places where they used to live have been built on . in gardens they can be killed by cats .
