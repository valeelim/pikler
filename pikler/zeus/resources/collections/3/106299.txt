John Dowland     john dowland ( born 1563 ; buried 20 february 1626 ) was an english composer and lutenist . he is best known for some beautiful songs which express his unhappiness such as `` come , heavy sleep '' , `` come again , sweet love '' and `` flow my tears '' . his instrumental music became very popular again in the 20th century . we hardly know anything about dowland 's early life . he was probably born in london . he went to paris in 1580 where he worked for the ambassador to the french court . he became a roman catholic at this time . in 1594 the job of royal lutenist to queen elizabeth i became available . dowland did not get the job . he said later that it was because he was a catholic , but there were other catholic musicians at the english court , so that may not have been the real reason . dowland continued to work in europe instead . he worked for the duke of brunswick-lüneburg in wolfenbüttel . he went to italy where he wanted to study with luca marenzio in rome . he went to venice and florence but never got as far as rome . he published a book of lute music in 1597 which made him the most important english composer for the lute . however , he still did not get a job at the english court so he went to denmark where he worked for king christian iv of denmark who paid him very well .
