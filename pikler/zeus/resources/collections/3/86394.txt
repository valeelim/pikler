Dattatreya     dattatreya is the god who is an incarnation of the divine trinity brahma , vishnu and siva . the word datta means `` given '' , datta is called so because the divine trinity have `` given '' themselves in the form of a son to the sage couple atri and anasuya . he is the son of atri , hence the name `` atreya . '' in the nath tradition , dattatreya is seen as an avatar or incarnation of the lord shiva and as the adi-guru ( first teacher ) of the adi-nath sampradaya of the nathas . although dattatreya was at first a `` lord of yoga '' with tantric traits , he was adapted and assimilated into the more devotional cults ; while still worshiped by millions of hindus , he is approached more as a benevolent god than as a teacher of the highest essence of indian thought . though the dattatreya of the natha tradition coexisted and intermingled with the puranic , brahmanical tradition of the datta sampradaya , here we shall focus almost exclusively on the earlier tantric manifestation of datta . shri gurudev mahendranath had no doubt that dattatreya was an historical figure . he stated that datta was born on wednesday , the fourteenth day of the full moon in the month of margasirsa , though he does not mention the year .
