Internal combustion engine     an internal combustion engine is an engine in which combustion , or the burning of fuel , occurs on the inside . it is a machine that makes large pressure increases inside a sealed box ( cylinder ) . the pressure increase pushes a rod which is attached to a wheel . the rod pushes the wheel and makes it spin around . the spinning wheel is attached to other wheels , such as four car wheels , with a belt or a chain . the engine is very strong and can make all the wheels move . engines need oil to make them slippery or the moving parts would grind together and stick . parts of a car engine are measured to 0.01 of a millimeter and some engine parts fit together very tightly . internal differs from external combustion where the fire is outside the engine , such as a steam engine . most road vehicles use the internal combustion engine today , and most of those use the four-stroke engine . rocket and jet engines are combustion engines but they do not turn wheels . the fire in their combustion chamber pushes gases rapidly out the back , which pushes the rocket forward .
