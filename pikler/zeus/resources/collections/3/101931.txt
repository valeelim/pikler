Relation (mathematics)    relation ( mathematics ) in mathematics , an `` n-ary relation '' on `` n '' sets , is any subset of cartesian product of the `` n '' sets . the relation is `` homogeneous '' when it is formed with one set . for example any curve in the cartesian plane is a subset of the cartesian product of real numbers , `` rxr '' . the homogeneous binary relations are studied for properties like reflexiveness , symmetry , and transitivity which determine different kinds of orderings on the set . heterogeneous `` n-ary '' relations , are used in the semantics of predicate calculus , and in relational databases . in relational databases jargon , the relations are called tables . there is a relational algebra consisting in the operations on sets , because relations are sets , extended with operators like projection , which forms a new relation selecting a subset of the columns ( tuple entries ) in a table , the selection operator , which selects just the rows ( tuples ) , according to some condition , and join which works like a composition operator . the use of the term `` relation '' is often used as shorthand to refer to binary relations , where the set of all the starting points is called the `` domain '' and the set of the ending points is the `` codomain '' .
