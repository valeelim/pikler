Attribute-value system     an attribute-value system is a basic knowledge representation framework comprising a table with columns designating `` attributes '' ( also known as `` properties '' , `` predicates , '' `` features , '' `` dimensions , '' `` characteristics '' or `` independent variables '' depending on the context ) and rows designating `` objects '' ( also known as `` entities , '' `` instances , '' `` exemplars , '' `` elements '' or `` dependent variables. '' ) . each table cell therefore designates the value ( also known as `` state '' ) of a particular attribute of a particular object . below is a sample attribute-value system . it represents 10 objects ( rows ) and five features ( columns ) . in this example , the table contains only integer values . in general , an attribute-value system may contain any kind of data , numeric or otherwise . an attribute-value system is distinguished from a simple `` feature list '' representation in that each feature in an attribute-value system may possess a range of values ( e.g. , feature formula_1 below , which has domain of { 0,1,2 } ) , rather than simply being `` present '' or `` absent ''
