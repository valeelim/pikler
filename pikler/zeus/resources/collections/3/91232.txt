Anti-Armenianism     anti-armenianism is hostility toward or prejudice against armenian people , armenian culture and the republic of armenia , which can range in expression from individual hatred to institutionalized persecution . several organizations have stated that difficulties currently experienced by the armenian minority in turkey are a result of an anti-armenian attitude by the turkish government as well as by ultra-nationalist groups such as the grey wolves . modern anti-armenianism often seems to lacks a racial and cultural basis and appears to be based more on geopolitics and history , in addition to diplomatic and strategic interests , involving the modern states of turkey and azerbaijan . the controversy and emotions surrounding the armenian genocide and nagorno-karabakh are two examples of intense anti-armenianism in both countries . modern anti-armenianism is usually associated with either extreme opposition to the actions or existence of the armenian republic , and belief in an armenian conspiracy .
