324 Bamberga     324 bamberga is the 16th biggest asteroid in the main asteroid belt . it was found by johann palisa on february 25 , 1892 in vienna , making it one of the last big ( diameter over 200 km ) asteroids found . apart from the near-earth asteroid eros , it was the last asteroid which is `` ever '' easily visible with binoculars to be found . although its very high orbital eccentricity means its opposition magnitude varies a lot , at a rare opposition near perihelion bamberga can reach a magnitude of +8.0 , which is as bright as saturn 's moon titan . such near-perihelion oppositions happen on a regular cycle every twenty-two years , with the last happening in 1991 and the next in 2013. its brightness at these rare near-perihelion oppositions makes bamberga the `` brightest c-type asteroid '' , about one magnitude brighter than 10 hygiea 's maximum brightness of around +9.1 . at such an opposition bamberga can in fact be closer to earth than any main belt asteroid with magnitude above +9.5 , getting as close as 0.78 au . for comparison , 7 iris never comes closer than 0.85 au and 4 vesta never closer than 1.13 au when it becomes visible to the naked eye in a pollution-free sky .
