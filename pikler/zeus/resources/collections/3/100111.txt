'' ( tniv ) paul scolds the church members there for sexual immorality and asks for these immoral people to be thrown out of the church . he gives instructions for marriage , against worshipping worthless idols ( idolatory ) , for spiritual gifts like prophecy . paul praises the superior way of love and urges the church to be united . at the end , paul states that the resurrection of christ is true . he supports it with testimonies from `` more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters '' and it is this very truth which makes certain the believers will have eternal life .
