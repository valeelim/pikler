Dalmatian Italians     dalmatian italians are italians whose family comes from dalmatia in today 's croatia , montenegro and bosnia-erzegovina . dalmatian italians are one of the historical ethnic groups of dalmatia ( in today 's republics of croatia and montenegro ) . they are direct descendants of the autochthonous population of the romanised illyrians in present dalmatia , since the middle ages when they lived in the dalmatian city-states and surrounding islands . after the 1840s their ethnic group suffered from a constant trend of decreasing presence and now numbers only around 1,000 people . this group , though small in numbers , exerted an unproportionally significant and noteworthy influence on the region in the last centuries . indeed the dalmatian italians were a fundamental presence in dalmatia , when the process of political unification of the italians , croats and serbs started at the beginning of the 19th century . the 1816 austro-hungarian census registered 66,000 italian speaking people between the 301,000 inhabitants of dalmatia , or 22 % of the total dalmatian population . but in 2010 they were reduced to only a few hundreds .
