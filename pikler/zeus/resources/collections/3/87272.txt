Thelema     thelema is the english spelling of the greek noun : `` will '' , from the verb `` θέλω '' : to will , wish , purpose . early christian writings use the word to refer to the will of god , the human will , and even the will of god 's opponent , the devil . thelema is also a way of life first written about by françois rabelais ( 16th century ) in his famous books of fiction , gargantua and pantagruel . the core of this way of life was summed up in the phrase `` do what thou wilt '' ( `` fay çe que vouldras '' in the original old french ) . this idea was later put into practice in the mid 18th century by sir francis dashwood at medmenham . this thelemic law of rabelais was revived by aleister crowley in 1904 when crowley wrote `` the book of the law '' . this book contains both the word `` thelema '' in greek as well as the phrase `` do what thou wilt . '' from this , crowley took thelema as the name of his own religion . thus shri gurudev mahendranath wrote that rabelais , dashwood , and crowley must share the honor of perpetuating thelema .
