Le Chatelier's principle    le chatelier 's principle the le ch√¢telier 's principle is a principle used in chemistry . it is a system that tries to make up for the changes that affect the system at equilibrium . it is used to see the effects of relations between concentration , pressure , and temperature . if a change of condition is added onto a system at equilibrium , the equilibrium position will shift in the direction that wants to reduce that change . equilibrium is measured by concentration of a chemistry substance . if there is more concentration , the extra material must be used up to try to set the change back at equilibrium . it tries to fill the void . pressure is applied to an airy substance called gas . if there is more pressure , the system will take away the number of molecules , leaving with fewer gas molecules . if heat is added , the system moves away from heat so it can use it up . in an endothermic reaction , if temperature is increased then the products will increase in order to stabilize this change ( stress ) in the reaction .
