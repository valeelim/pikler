Papuan languages     the term papuan languages means languages of the western pacific which are neither austronesian nor australian . that is , the term is defined negatively and does not mean a linguistic relationship . the majority of the papuan languages are spoken on the island of new guinea ( which is divided between the country of papua new guinea and indonesian provinces of papua and west irian jaya ) , with a number spoken in the bismarck archipelago , bougainville island , and the solomon islands to the east , and in halmahera , timor , and the alor archipelago to the west . one papuan language , meriam mir , is spoken within the national borders of australia , in the eastern torres strait . the only papuan languages with official recognition are those of east timor . new guinea is perhaps the most linguistically diverse region in the world . besides the austronesian languages , there are some 800 languages divided into perhaps sixty small language families , with unclear relationships to each other or to anything else , plus a large number of language isolates .
