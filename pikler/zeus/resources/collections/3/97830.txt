Camera obscura     camera obscura is latin for `` dark chamber . '' it is the name given to a simple device used to produce images that would lead to the invention of photography . the english word for today 's photographic devices is merely a shortening of this name to `` camera '' . at its most basic , the camera obscura is a simple box ( which may be room-sized ) with a small hole in one side , ( see pinhole camera for details on how to build one ) . light from only one part of a scene will pass through the hole and strike a specific part of the back wall . ( the projection can be made on paper on which an artist can copy the image . ) as the pinhole is made smaller , the image gets sharper , but the light-sensitivity decreases . with this simple apparatus , the image is always upside-down . by using mirrors , as in the 18th century overhead version , it is also possible to project a `` right-side-up '' image . the first mention and discovery of the principles behind the pinhole camera , a precursor to the camera obscura , belong to mozi ( 470 bc to 390 bc ) , a chinese philosopher and founder of mohism . later , aristotle ( 384 to 322 bc ) understood the optical principle of the pinhole camera . he viewed the crescent shape of a partially eclipsed sun projected on the ground through the holes in a sieve , and the gaps between leaves of a plane tree .
