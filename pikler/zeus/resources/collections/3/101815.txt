Hyperion (poem)    hyperion ( poem ) hyperion is one of the major poems of the english romantic poet john keats . the poem is based on the tale from greek mythology that tells how the titan hyperion , the first greek sun god , was replaced by apollo . keats worked on the poem mainly in august and september 1818. he finished the first two sections or `` books , '' each between 350 and 400 lines long , and he also wrote 135 lines of book iii . but he was not satisfied with what he had written ; he re-wrote it bit by bit until april 1819 , when he gave up for a while . some critics and scholars think that keats set out to write the kind of long poem he had already done in his `` endymion '' in 1817 â€“ but his outlook on poetry had changed , to a point where he was no longer happy writing the kind of mythological epic that many other poets of his time tried to write . keats tried to re-do the poem in a new form that he called `` the fall of hyperion '' . he worked on this second version during the last six months of 1819 , and though he wrote more than 500 lines , he gave up this second attempt too . he was never able to complete either version of the poem in a way that satisfied him .
