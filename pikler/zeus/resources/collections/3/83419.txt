Wedge (mechanics)    wedge ( mechanics ) a wedge is a simple machine used mainly to separate two objects . a wedge as a tool is used to push two things apart such as the blade of a knife does when it cuts wood . a wedge can also be used to lift an object or hold an object in place . the mechanical advantage of a wedge depends on the ratio of its length to its thickest part . the origin of the wedge is unknown , because it has been in use as early as the stone age . circa 3000 bc , in ancient egypt quarries , bronze wedges were used to break away blocks of rock used for construction . wood wedges , that swelled after being wet , were also used . some native american tribes used antler wedges as a means of splitting and working wood to make canoes , houses , and other wood objects . examples include axes , splitting mauls , and splitting wedges . wedges can also be used to lift heavy objects , or finely adjust the height of objects , essentially separating them from the surface they rest on . these may also be referred to as shims . knives , scissors , chisels , and even teeth can sometimes be used as wedges , however , they are more fundamentally cutting implements .
