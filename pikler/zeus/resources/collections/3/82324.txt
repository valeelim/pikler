Anglo-Saxon mythology     anglo-saxon mythology refers to the migration period germanic paganism practiced by the english peoples in 5th to 7th century england . the anglo-saxons , composed of tribes of the angles , saxons , friesian and jutes , arrived in britain from southern scandinavia , the netherlands and northern germany . it is from these people that the modern english language ( angle-ish ) derives . an impression , but only that , of the anglo-saxon mythology can be obtained from reading about scandinavian mythology . the latter was written down much later , by snorri sturluson , because iceland remained pagan until well into the christian era ( c.1000 ) . the norse of iceland and the english certainly shared a common ancestry in 6th century denmark . the anglo-saxons were a largely illiterate society and tales were orally transmitted between groups and tribes by the anglo-saxon traveling minstrels , the scops , in the form of verse . the chief literary source is bede , a christian monk who wrote of the old english calendar in his `` de temporum ratione '' . only a little old english poetry has survived , and all of it has had christian editors . the epic poem `` beowulf '' is an important source of anglo-saxon pagan poetry and history , but it is clearly addressed to a christian audience , containing numerous references to the christian god , and using christian phrasing and metaphor . the monster grendel , for example , is described as a descendant of the biblical cain . in fact , the only fragment of poetry dating to the pagan era that has not undergone edits by christian editors is the `` finnsburgh fragment '' .
