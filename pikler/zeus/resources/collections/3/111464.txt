Philosophy of language     philosophy of language is the study of how languages were created and are used . it is part of linguistics . in continental philosophy , it is not treated as a subject by itself , but ludwig wittgenstein and other analytic philosophers placed particular stress on it . like all philosophies , there are some central questions that are important in philosophy of language : - what does it mean for a word to mean something ? why do some words have the same meaning ? how can we ever know if a word means something or not ? why are some orderings of words meaningful , while others are not ? - how are languages learnt ? how do they change ? - how important are languages in communication ? - how do we translate from one language into another ? - what does truth have to do with language ? plato was the first philosopher we know was interested in philosophy of language ( although his teacher socrates probably was too ) . he believed that the smallest parts of words ( phonemes ) had meaning even if they were outside the words they are in . this is not a very good theory , and plato understood that there were things wrong with it . the stoics also made a complicated philosophy of language .
