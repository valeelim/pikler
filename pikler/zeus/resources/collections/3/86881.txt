Analogy     analogy is an important way of thinking . a person sees something new , and thinks 'what is it ' ? then he might think , 'ah , it 's like something i have seen before ... ' so an analogy is a comparison between two things which we think are similar in some way . we compare two things , or two systems , and think they have something important in common . there is a difference between superficial analogies and profound analogies . two things might look alike , but work quite differently , or they might look different , but work in ways like each other . most effort is put into finding profound analogies which teach us something worth knowing . as another philosopher puts is : mario bunge sees analogy as a main way of getting new hypotheses which can be tested . he points out that analogies may be based on similarities in behaviour , or in structure . famous examples . - the parables of jesus are analogies . for instance , in the parable of the sower the analogy of the seed falling on good ground is to `` such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit '' .
