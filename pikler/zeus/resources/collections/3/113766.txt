Pioneer movement     pioneer movements are movements for children and adolescents . they were founded in countries where there is a communist party . many of the ideas are taken from the scout movement . in most socialist countries , people can choose if they want to be members of the pioneer movement or not . there are many differences between a pioneer movement , and the scout movement . scout movements are independent of governments . they are also not controlled by the state . for example , there were no separate organizations for boys and girls . during the time of the ussr , thousands of young pioneer camps and young pioneer palaces were built . these could only be used by young pioneers . the camps and palaces were also free of charge , it did not cost any money to use them . the government and trade unions sponsored them . there were many newspapers and magazines published for young pioneers . some sold millions of copies . certain features , however , are similar to the scout movement . the two movements share some principles like preparedness and promotion of sports and outdoor skills . the pioneer movement also includes teaching of communist principles . opponents of communist states claim that this is a form of indoctrination .
