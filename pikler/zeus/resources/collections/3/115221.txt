Carl Correns     carl erich correns ( 10 september 1864 – 14 february 1933 ) was a german botanist and geneticist . his research into heredity led to his rediscovery of gregor mendel 's earlier work . hugo de vries also – independently – rediscovered gregor mendel 's work on genetics . erich von tschermak 's status as a third rediscoverer is now less convincing . correns grew hybrids of peas , and of maize , and reached the same interpretation as mendel , in 1899. the occurrence of cases in which the heterozygote is intermediate ( the absence of dominance ) was added in a footnote to his 1900 paper . that dominance was not always present had been seen and understood by mendel , according to his letters to nägeli . by a quirk of history correns was a student of nägeli , a renowned botanist with whom mendel corresponded about his work with peas . nägeli failed to understand how significant mendel 's work was . in 1913 correns became the first director of the newly founded kaiser wilhelm institute for biology in berlin-dahlem .
