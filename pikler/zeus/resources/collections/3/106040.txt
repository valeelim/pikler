( hogan , 2007 ) water quality turbidity is quite high due to extensive sand and gravel mining in stream . according to a 2001 research by dr. jianguo liu of michigan state university , the rate of destruction is higher after the reserve 's creation than before its creation . using nasa 's satellite images and records of the number of people there , liu 's research team concluded that due to tourism and the increase in the number of people , the reserve is facing an unprecedented threat . `` tourists do not think they have an impact on panda habitat , but indirectly each visitor has some impact , '' liu said . `` we do not see ourselves as a destructive force , but we are .
