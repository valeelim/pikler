Fold mountain     fold mountains are mountains formed mainly by the effects of folding on layers in the upper part of the earth 's crust . the term is rather out of date , though still fairly common in physical geography literature . in the time before plate tectonics became well understood , the term was used for mountain belts , such as the himalayas . these mountain ranges are `` not '' caused by the folding of the earth 's crust . the main mechanism causing a thickening of the crust at these sites of continent-continent collision along a convergent boundary is thrust faulting . fold mountains are formed when two tectonic plates move together ( a convergent plate boundary ) . fold mountains are usually formed from sedimentary rocks which accumulated along the margins of continents . when plates and the continents riding on them collide , the accumulated layers of rock may crumple and fold like a tablecloth that is pushed across a table , particularly if there is a mechanically weak basal layer such as salt .
