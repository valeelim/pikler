Angstrom     an angstrom or ångström ( symbol å ) is a non-si unit of length that is internationally recognized . it equals 0.1 nanometer ( nm ) . it can be written in scientific notations as 1×10 m ( normalized notation ) or ( exponential notation ) — both mean . it is sometimes used to express the sizes of atoms , lengths of chemical bonds and visible-light spectra , and dimensions of parts of integrated circuits . the ångström is named after the swedish physicist anders jonas ångström ( 1814–1874 ) , one of the founders of spectroscopy who is known also for studies of astrophysics , heat transfer , terrestrial magnetism , and the aurora borealis . in 1868 , ångström created a spectrum chart of solar radiation that expresses the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum in multiples of one ten-millionth of a millimetre , or 1 metres . this unit of length later became known as the ångström , å. the visual sensitivity of a human being is from about 4,000 ångstroms ( violet ) to 7,000 ångstroms ( deep red ) so the use of the ångström as a unit provided a fair amount of discrimination without resort to fractional units . because of its closeness to the scale of atomic and molecular structures it also became popular in chemistry and crystallography .
