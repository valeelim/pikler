'' , `` finding nemo '' and `` wall-e '' were also brought up and the three decided to have the grasshoppers demand food instead of begging for it , as it is in the fable . akira kurosawa 's `` seven samurai '' helped influence the project . a basic story treatment was completed in 1995 and production began soon after . the movie had many technical challenges . one of the biggest technical triumphs was the simulation of crowds of ants . it would be impossible for an animator to animate every single ant in a crowd of thousands . so the technical supervisors came up with a computer program that would make every single ant in the crowd different in small ways ; for example , different eye colour , skin colour , weight , or height . they would also build a several ants that could be animated . when randomly distributed through the crowds , these ants would appear to be blinking , talking , or looking in different directions .
