Dual monarchy     dual monarchy is a union of two monarchies where the thrones of each monarchy are combined . a typical case is a personal union in which the crowns of the separate kingdoms are held by one person . the following are examples of dual monarchies , listed alphabetically with the dominant or co-dominant nation first : - austria-hungary , a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918 . - babylon and nippur during the second half of the rule of the kassite government in babylonia , the 13th and 12th centuries bc ; the governor of nippur , the `` guennakku '' , ruled as a secondary administrative monarch . - brandenburg and prussia from 1618 until the formation of the german empire in 1871 . - castile and aragón from the union of 1469 resulting from the marriage of ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella of castile until the abolition of the crown of aragón by the nueva planta decrees in 1707. the kingdom of spain technically existed as a dual monarchy for 238 years and , for this reason , american history lessons about spain at the time of the voyages of christopher columbus teach not simply about `` king ferdinand , '' but about `` ferdinand and isabella .
