Benzaiten     benzaiten ( 弁才天 , 弁財天 ) is the japanese name of the goddess saraswati . worship of benzaiten arrived in japan in the 6th to 8th centuries , mainly through the chinese translations of the `` sutra of golden light `` . her sanskrit name is `` sarasvatî devî '' , which means `` flowing water '' . this is why benzaiten is the goddess of everything that flows : water , words , speech , and music . the characters used to write her name showed her as the goddess of eloquence . because of the sutra of golden light , in japan she became a protector of the people . lastly , she became one of the seven lucky gods . in the rig-veda ( 6.61.7 ) sarasvati killed the three-headed snake , also known as vritra . this is probably one of the sources of sarasvati/benzaiten 's close link with snakes and dragons in japan . she has a shrine on the island of enoshima in sagami bay , about 50 kilometers south of tokyo ; and a five-headed dragon and her are the main people in the enoshima engi , a history of the shrines on enoshima written by the japanese buddhist monk kokei ( 皇慶 ) . according to kokei , benzaiten is the third daughter of the dragon-king of munetsuchi ( 無熱池 ; literally `` lake without heat '' ) , the lake which is at the center of the world in an ancient buddhist view .
