Leptictidium     leptictidium ( meaning delicate weasel ) was a genus of small prehistoric eutherian from eocene period . this extinct species of mammal lived alongside the dinosaurs , but died out when the tropical forests opened up . leptictidium had long hind legs , and probably used only those two legs when moving fast . whether it hopped on two legs or ran bipedally is still a matter of debate . it had a long , bare tail which acted as a counterbalance , and a long , mobile snout to help it find its prey . the leptictids were found right across eurasia . leptictidium itself was a specialised hopper with the best preserved specimens found in the messel shales of germany .
