Postal codes in Germany     postal codes in germany , ( plz ) ( plural postleitzahlen ) , have five numbers . the first two show the wide area , the three other show the postal district . the present system was introduced on 1 july 1993. before reunification , both the federal republic of germany ( frg ) and the german democratic republic ( ddr ) used four-digit codes . there was a temporary system after reunification . between 1989 and 1993 postal codes in the west started with `` w '' , eg `` w-1000 berlin 30 '' ( postal districts in western cities were separate from the postal code ) and those in the east with `` o '' ( for `` ost '' ) , e.g . : `` o-1234 berlin '' . companies that posted a lot of letters , have their own postal codes , separate from those used for postal districts or po box number ranges . postal regions do not always follow state borders . this is because sometimes it is easier to deliver mail to a place on the border from the other state . the postal regions and some postal codes are : saxony and saxony-anhalt . 01 region dresden .
