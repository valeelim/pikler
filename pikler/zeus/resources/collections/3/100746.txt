British War Medal     the british war medal was a medal given to people who had fought in the first world war . the medal was originally meant to be for people who had fought in the war between 5th august 1914 and 11th november 1918 , but this was later changed to the years between 1914 and 1920. this was because a lot of people still lost their lives in the armed forces even after the war had ended , because they were clearing landmines or mines at sea . the british war medal ( often shortened to bwm ) was awarded to both officers and men of the royal marines , royal navy , the army and also the dominion and colonial forces . the dominion and colonial forces were the armed forces for the rest of the british empire . to qualify for ( be allowed to have ) the medal , a member of the fighting forces had to have left his native country in any part of the british empire whilst on military duty . there were over six and a half million british war medals given out . most of them are made of silver , but some rarer ones are made of bronze instead . they are all circular , and have different designs on each side . each side of a medal is called a `` face '' . the face that usually has a picture of the side view of a person 's head on it is called the `` obverse '' , and the other side of the medal is called the `` reverse '' . the picture of the person 's head is more commonly known as a `` bust '' , which is a type of statue that only shows the head , neck and tops of the shoulders of the person it is meant to be .
