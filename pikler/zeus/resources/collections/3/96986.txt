Database schema     in computer science a `` schema '' or database schema describes the structure of a database in a formal language that is supported by the database management system . using the database schema , it is possible to create a blueprint of the database . this blueprint will not contain any data . the database schema uses logical formulas to create integrity constraints . it is not possible to insert data into the database that violates these integrity constraints . all contraints use the same language . there are different kinds of database schemas : - the conceptual schema expresses the concepts in the database , and how they relate to each other - the logical schema is a mapping of entities with their attributes , and the respective relations - the physical schema is a particular implementation of a logical schema . ideally , a database schema should have the following properties : - it should be `` complete '' : all information in the source should be included . - it should be `` minimal '' : it should not be possible to leave out a relation , without losing information
