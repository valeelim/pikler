Pointe shoes     pointe shoes are special shoes worn by ballerinas . they are made with a wide flat front end so that the ballerina can stand on the tips of her toes . in normal flat ballet shoes , people can not do this because the shoe will not support their feet properly . pointe shoes are normally only worn by female ballet dancers ; male dancers may wear them for unorthodox roles such as the ugly stepsisters in `` cinderella '' , or bottom in `` a midsummer night 's dream '' . girls will usually start en pointe between the ages of 10 and 13. starting too early may be bad for the feet of the dancer . dance teachers ' societies give their members information and advice on this subject . some girls will never go en pointe . this is usually because they are not strong enough , as going en pointe means one has to have enough strength . ballet class is not social dancing , it is aimed at professional training . but the basic pre-pointe class may still be useful for young dancers who later move into , for example , stage dancing . in that case , the lack of pointe work would not interfere with their eventual employment .
