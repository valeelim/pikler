Sikhism in Pakistan     sikhism is a very small minority religion in the islamic republic of pakistan but has many cultural , historical and political ties to the country , and to the historical region of the punjab . today , pakistan , a nation of over 170 million , is 97 % muslim , with christians and hindus making up the largest minority faiths , each absorbing about 1.5 % of the population . sikhs , zoroastrians , buddhists , members of heterodox ( according to pakistani law ) islamic faiths and some adherents to animist religions make up the remainder . information is scarce on minority adherents . according to the cia fact file , there are no more than 20,000 sikhs in pakistan now . to put this in perspective had there not been a partition in 1947 then the region that is called pakistan to day would have had around 13 million sikhs .
