Raster graphics     raster graphics ( or bitmap graphics ) is one of two kinds of computer graphics . with raster graphics , images are modeled as big collections of pixels . usually they form an image shaped like a rectangle . each pixel holds something , like color or transparency . raster images are used very often . computer screens are made of a raster of points . vector graphic images are rasterised that way . images that are difficult to make as a vector , like photographs , are often made in the form of a raster image . many printers today use computer languages like postscript or pcl . these languages are based on vectorized images , most of the time . to be printed , these images need to be translated into raster graphics first . this is done by a part called a raster image processor . most modern printers have those processors inside the printer . some printers use a special piece of software on the computer to do that job .
