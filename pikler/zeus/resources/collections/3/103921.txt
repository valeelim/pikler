Petabyte     a petabyte ( pb ) is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices . one petabyte holds 1000 terabytes ( tb ) or a thousand trillion ( 1,000,000,000,000,000 ) bytes . large organisations use petabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data . to store this amount of data at home would require about 1000 large home computers . people at home probably do not use petabytes , they would use terabytes ( primarily for very large backups ) , gigabytes , megabytes and occasionally kilobytes . one thousand petabytes make one exabyte .
