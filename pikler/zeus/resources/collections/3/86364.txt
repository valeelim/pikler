Chakra     a chakra is an energy centre in the human body as taught in indian yoga and some related cultures . chakras are also believed in by some new age adherents . chakra means 'wheel ' in sanskrit . a chakra is an area in the body connected with life energy . there are seven chakras in the body - each is an interface for the flow of life energy . a chakra vitalizes a physical body and is associated with interactions of a physical or mental nature . current science is not able to detect or measure chakras . although there are various interpretations as to what exactly a chakra is , the following features are common in all systems : - they form part of a subtle energy body , along with the energy channels , or nadis , and the subtle winds , or pranas . - they are located along a central nadi , sushumna , which runs either alongside or inside the spine . - two other nadis , ida and pingala , also run through the chakras , and alongside sushumna . they occasionally cross sushumna at the location of the chakras .
