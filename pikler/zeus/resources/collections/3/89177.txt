Democracy in Athens     democracy in ancient athens was very different from modern democracy . to be classed as a citizen in fifth-century athens you had to be male , born from two athenian parents and over eighteen years old . women , slaves , metics and children were not allowed to become citizens . citizens could be involved in the running of athens and could be elected for important positions . athens had a direct democracy . this meant that each citizen had an equal say and opportunity in the governing of athens . all of the citizens of athens would meet on a hillside ( the pnyx ) 30 to 40 times a year to discuss how to run the city better . all democratic countries now have an indirect democracy . this means members of parliament are elected to make decisions concerning government . there are now too many people in different countries for them to meet on a hillside , and many people are too busy to be able to go 50 times a year . all citizens could attend fifty meetings a year . meetings were held on a hillside called the pnyx . people would stand on a raised platform called the bema to speak . speakers wore a garland whilst speaking . any citizen could speak .
