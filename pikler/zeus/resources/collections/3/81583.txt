Callisto (moon)    callisto ( moon ) callisto is a moon of the planet jupiter , discovered in 1610 by galileo galilei . it is the second largest moon orbiting jupiter , after ganymede , and the third largest moon in the solar system . callisto is almost the same size as the planet mercury , being 99 % the diameter of the planet , but is much less massive . of the four galilean moons of jupiter , callisto is the farthest out , with an orbital radius of about 1,880,000 kilometres . it does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner galilean satellites , io , europa and ganymede . like the earth 's moon , callisto rotates synchronously with its orbital period . this means that one side is always turned toward jupiter , while the other side never sees the face of the planet . callisto 's surface is less affected by jupiter 's magnetosphere than the seven moons nearer the planet . callisto has about equal amounts of rock and ices , with an average density of about 1.83 g/cmÂ³ . compounds on the surface include water ice , carbon dioxide , silicates , and organics . the galileo spacecraft made investigations of the moon , and revealed that callisto may have a small silicate core and possibly a subsurface ocean of liquid water more than 100 kilometers deep .
