Group (periodic table)    group ( periodic table ) a group in the periodic table is any column of elements with common properties denoted by the electrons in the outermost layer . there are eight groups of elements in total : - group 1 : the alkali metals are the most reactive elements , when mixed with water they form acids . elements include : hydrogen ( h ) and lithium ( li ) - group 2 : the alkaline earth metals - group 3 : the boron family - group 4 : the carbon family - group 5 : the nitrogen family ( pnictogens ) - group 6 : the oxygen family ( chalcogens ) - group 7 : the halogens or fluorine family . these still are not very reactive but do react - group 8 : the noble gases or helium family/neon family . they are known as noble gasses as they do not react to most circumstances . elements include : helium ( he ) and argon ( ar )
