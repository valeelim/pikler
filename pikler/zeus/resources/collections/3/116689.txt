The Rake's Progress    the rake 's progress the rake 's progress is an opera by igor stravinsky . the libretto written by w. h. auden and chester kallman is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings from the 18th century by william hogarth called `` a rake 's progress '' . stravinsky had seen these paintings in 1947 at an exhibition in chicago . the rake ’ s progress tells the story of a man called tom rakewell . the word “ rake ” in this sense means “ someone ( usually a man ) who behaves in an immoral way : a man who has relationships with lots of women . the word “ progress ” in the title is ironic because tom does not really make progress : he does not become a better man . in a sense he progresses backwards , because he starts off in a state of blissful innocence , i.e . he does not understand anything about his life , he does not know about good and bad . at the end of the opera he also does not understand anything about his life , but that is because he has gone mad . tom is like faust because he sells his soul to the devil . in this opera the character nick shadow represents the devil . tom leaves his lover anne trulove and goes to find lots of other women in london . he has several adventures , which are all arranged by nick who is helping him to have a good time . in the end tom finds himself in bedlam which was a horrible building where mad people were sent in the 18th century .
