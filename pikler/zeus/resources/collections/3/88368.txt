Jacob Obrecht     jacob obrecht ( born ghent , 1457 or 1458 ; died late july , 1505 ) was a composer from the south netherlands . he was one of the greatest composers of his time . he is best known for his church music , including many masses as well as motets and songs . obrecht ’ s father was a trumpeter . his mother died when he was about 2 years old and his father remarried . we know nothing about obrecht ’ s musical education . he may have learned to play the trumpet like his father , who worked for the burgundian court . perhaps his father introduced him to people at the court , such as the famous composer antoine busnois . he certainly must have known busnois ’ music . from 1480-1484 he was a choirmaster at bergen-op-zoom . then he got a very good job as choirmaster at cambrai cathedral . however , a year later he took another job in bruges . he wrote a lot of church music during his years in bruges . he travelled to italy and went to the town of ferrara where a lot of famous musicians worked . he stayed there for several months . this may have been the reason why he then lost his job in bruges . his next job was in antwerp where he worked from 1492 to 1498. he then got his old job back in bruges . from 1501 to 1503 he once again worked at antwerp where he was choirmaster at the church of our lady . in 1504 he got the job of maestro di cappella at ferrara , but the following year he died of the plague .
