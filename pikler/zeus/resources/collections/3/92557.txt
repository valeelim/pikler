Kharijite     `` kharijites '' were a movement during the early years of islam . this movement has no followers today . at first they accepted the rule of ali , but rejected him to later support the view that abu bakr , and his successors were the rightful caliphs . the only group of kharijites that still exists are the ibadi . the ibadi do not consider themselves to be kharijite . most ibadis live in oman . smaller numbers live in algeria , tunisia , libya and zanzibar . sometimes , the term `` kharijite '' ( or `` neo-kharijite '' ) is also used for some islamic terrorist groups . examples of such groups are the groupe islamique arm√© in algeria , or the takfir wal-hijra in egypt .
