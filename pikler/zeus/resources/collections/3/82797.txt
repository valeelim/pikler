Wiwaxia     wiwaxia corrugata is an extinct species of animal known only from fossils found in canada 's burgess shale deposits . wiwaxia somewhat resembles a very small porcupine ( about 30 mm in diameter ) with its quills pulled out . the body is covered by both spines and scales . the spines are believed to have been used for defence purposes . wiwaxia probably grazed or scavenged by walking or crawling along the sediment . one hundred and forty specimens are known from the burgess shale . similar scales and spines have turned up in similarly aged sediments from elsewhere around the world suggesting that wiwaxia was widespread during the cambrian .
