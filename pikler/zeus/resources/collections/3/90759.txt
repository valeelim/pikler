Shame     shame is an emotion . shame is rooted in a social or cultural environment . some people feel shame when some of the rules ( that are accepted by the respective society ) have been broken . a person can feel ashamed because he or she has thought or done something no one else knows about . children are often told to be ashamed of something , because they sometimes have trouble telling cause and effect apart . when they grow up , they can better tell the two apart . at that stage , the feeling of guilt becomes stronger .
