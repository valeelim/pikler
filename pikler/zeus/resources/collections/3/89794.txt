Iconoclasm     iconoclasm means symbols of a culture ( like icons or monuments ) being destroyed by people of that same culture . this is usually done for religious or political motives . often , it occurs together with major political or religious changes . it is generally distinct from destruction by foreigners , for example by spanish conquistadors in america . the term does not generally include the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow ( `` damnatio memoriae '' ) , for example akhenaten in ancient egypt . people who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts . this word is also used for people who are against established dogmata or conventions . similarly , people who revere or venerate religious images are called idolators . in an eastern orthodox context they are known as iconodules , or iconophiles . iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion , but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion . the two byzantine outbreaks during the 8th and 9th centuries were unusual because the use of images was the main issue in the dispute , rather than a by-product of wider concerns . in christianity , iconoclasm has generally been motivated by a literal interpretation of the ten commandments , which forbid the making and worshipping of `` graven images '' of god .
