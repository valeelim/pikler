Round Table     the round table was a table used by king arthur and his knights , in the legends about him . the round table was in camelot , the castle where king arthur and his knights lived . in the legends , they met at the table to talk about the safety of camelot and the kingdom , and about what adventures and quests they could go on . this got them the name 'the knights of the round table ' . the shape of the table was very important . most tables are rectangular , and have a place called the `` head of the table '' . this is the narrow part at the top , where the leader usually sits . because the table was round , it meant that the people who sat around it were all seen as equal . the table is used by king arthur and his knights . king arthur 's wife , guinevere , did not have a seat at the table , but king arthur did take her advice on occasion . in some versions of the legend , the wizard who lived in camelot , called merlin , also had a seat at the table . he was seen by king arthur as a good friend and adviser .
