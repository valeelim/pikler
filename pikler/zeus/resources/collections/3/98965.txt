Colubrid     a colubrid ( from latin `` coluber '' , snake ) is a snake that is a member of the colubridae `` family '' . colubridae is the largest snake family , and includes about two-thirds of all known living snake species . however , the colubrids are `` certainly not a natural group '' , and many are more closely related to other groups , such as elapids , than to each other . this family has classically been a dumping ground for snakes that do not fit anywhere else . there is on-going mitochondrial dna research which will sort out the familial relations within this group . a colubrid 's body is almost completely covered in scales . most colubrids are not venomous and are normally harmless . a few groups , such as genus `` boiga '' , can produce medically significant bites . in addition , the boomslang and african twig snake have both caused human fatalities . the venom-injecting fangs associated with venomous colubrids are almost always in the back of the mouth , in contrast to vipers and elapids . selected species . - boomslang
