Endangered species     an endangered species is a group ( population ) of animals , plants or other organisms that is in danger of becoming extinct . this could happen because there are few of that animal left , its predators have grown in number , or the climate that it lives in is changing , or the places it lives in have been destroyed . the world conservation union ( iucn ) has worked out that endangered species are 40 % of all organisms . many countries have laws to protect these plants and animals . these laws , if obeyed , can save species by stopping hunting , land development or making parks and reserves . poaching and other illegal activities , however , can still destroy them . only a few plants and animals at risk of extinction , mostly vertebrates , are put on the lists and get legal protection . many more species become extinct , or will become extinct , without people knowing about it . some of the animals that are listed as endangered are : - african wild dog - albatross - blue whale - crowned solitary eagle
