Maronite Church     maronites ( , transliterated : mawƒÅrinah , , ) are members of one of the syriac eastern catholic churches , with a heritage reaching back to maron in the early 5th century . the first maronite patriarch , john maron , was appointed in the late 7th century . although reduced in numbers and estimated to have lost their status as a majority in lebanon itself . today , maronites remain one of the principal religious groups in the country . before the conquest by arabian muslims reached lebanon , which resulted in the arabization of both those who would become islamized and those that would remain non-islamized , the lebanese people , including maronites , spoke a dialect of aramaic , but have been arabic-speaking since at least the 15th century . syriac however , still remains the liturgical language of the maronite church .
