Blockade of Germany     the blockade of germany , during world war i , was a part of the first battle of the atlantic between the united kingdom and germany . about 750,000 civilians died because of starvation caused by this blockade during the war . many more had to die from starvation after the armistice in november 1918 as the blockade was continued into 1919 , in order to force germany to sign the treaty of versailles in june 1919. the british established a naval blockade of germany early in the war . this blockade was unusually restrictive in that even food was stopped as it was said to help the war . the germans regarded this as an attempt to starve the german people into submission and wanted to fight back . they blockaded britain and france . as germany could not fight with the big british royal navy on an even basis , the only possible way germany could impose a blockade on britain was through the submarines . the chancellor of germany was against this sort of blockade because it meant attacking neutral ships as those of the united states as well . but the military pushed unlimited submarine warfare forward .
