Megaraptor     megaraptor was a large 20–26 feet ( 6–8 m ) long late cretaceous dinosaur . it had two large sickle-like claws on each hand . it was a lightly built biped , with a large head and sharp , serrated teeth in powerful jaws . the first fossil of `` megaraptor '' to be discovered was one of its claws . as they strongly resembled the claws seen in dromeosaurs , it was thought that megaraptor was a large member of that family . later , a complete hand was discovered , revealing the main claw was on its thumb . it is now classified either as a allosauroid carnosaur , related to `` neovenator '' , or right over on the other side of the theropoda as a tyrannosauroid coelurosaur .
