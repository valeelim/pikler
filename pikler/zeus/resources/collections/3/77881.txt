AIM-9 Sidewinder     the aim-9 sidewinder is a short-range air-to-air missile , which means it is shot from an aircraft and is supposed to hit an aircraft . it is heat seeking , which means it locks on to heat . it first flew in 1953 , and went into air forces in 1956. it was used during the vietnam war along with the aim-7 sparrow , but was not good . at the time , it would hit only 10-20 % of the time , and could be fooled . sometimes it could lock on to the sun or other bogus heat source and not an enemy airplane . the problems were later fixed , and the new sidewinders have a good hitting rate . it is in a lot of air forces . the missile can hit from 11 miles . it is used a lot .
