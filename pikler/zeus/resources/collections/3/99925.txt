Imaginary number     imaginary numbers are numbers that are made from combining a real number with the imaginary unit , called `` i '' , where `` i '' is defined as formula_1 . they are defined separately from the negative real numbers in that they are a square root of a negative real number instead of a positive real number . this is not possible with real numbers , as there is no real number that will multiply by itself to get a negative number ( e.g . 3*3 = 9 and -3*-3 = 9 ) . one way of thinking about them is to say that imaginary numbers are to negative numbers what negative numbers are to positive numbers . if i say `` go east by -1 mile '' it is the same as if i had said `` go west by 1 mile '' . if i say `` go east by i miles '' it means the same thing as if i had said `` go north by 1 mile '' . if i say `` go east by -i mile '' it means the same as if i had said `` go south by 1 mile '' . adding is easy too . if i say `` go east by 1 + i miles '' it means the same as if i had said `` go east by one mile and north by one mile '' . multiplying two imaginary numbers is a lot like multiplying a positive number with a negative number . if i say `` go east by 2*-3 miles '' it means `` rotate all of the way around ( so that you are now facing west ) and go 2*3 = 6 miles '' . imaginary numbers work the same , except that you can rotate part way . if i say go `` east by 2*3i miles '' , it means the same as if i had said `` rotate until you are facing north , and then go 2*3 = 6 miles ''
