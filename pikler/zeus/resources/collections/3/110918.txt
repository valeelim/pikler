Ichthyosaur     ichthyosaurs are an extinct order of marine reptiles from the mesozoic era . by the upper triassic they are similar in shape to dolphins and to fast predatory fish like tuna ( convergent evolution ) . they are found in marine strata from the earliest triassic to the cretaceous , though the early proto-ichthyosaurs are sometimes put in the broader category of ichthyopterygia . after transitional triassic types like `` mixosaurus '' and `` cymbospondylus '' , they have essentially the same body shape . `` californosaurus '' was one of the first to have the typical dolphin-like body shape . although isolated ichthyosaur vertebrae are quite common , the first fossil which showed the ichthyosaur form was found by mary anning ( 1799â€“1847 ) and her brother joseph . mary anning was an early british fossil collector , dealer and paleontologist . many of her finds may be seen today at the natural history museum , london . the genus `` ichthyosaurus '' was first described in 1699 from fossil fragments discovered in wales . the first fossil vertebrae were published twice in 1708. the first complete ichthyosaur fossil was found in 1811 by mary anning in lyme regis , along the jurassic coast . she later discovered three separate species .
