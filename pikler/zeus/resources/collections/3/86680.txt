Cipriano de Rore     cipriano de rore ( born in ronse , flanders , 1515 or 1516 ; died parma , september 1565 ) was a composer who lived in the renaissance period . he was flemish , but spent all his adult life in italy . the name de rore is a proper flemish name , not a name that has been changed to look italian . he was one of the most important composer of madrigals in the 16th century . there is very little known about rore 's early life . he was born in a small town called ronse ( renaix ) in what is now belgium . it is possible that he had music lessons in antwerp . we think that he was taken to italy by margaret of parma in 1533 as one of her servants . margaret , who was an illegitimate daughter of charles v , was very wealthy and she married into the medici family . rore probably continued to learn about music in italy . in his music publications de rore is called a “ disciple ” of adrian willaert . we do not know whether this means that he had lessons from willaert , or just that he learned to compose by studying willaert ’ s music . his first book of madrigals was published in 1542 , and then two books of motets were published .
