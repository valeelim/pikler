Standing stone     standing stones or menhirs are stones set into the ground vertically . they were put there by neolithic people in the british isles and brittany , and they also occur elsewhere in the world . there may be single standing stones , circles , lines or groups of them . their dates are mostly from 4000 bc to 1,500 bc . since neolithic peoples did not have writing , we know little about their use . it is generally thought they had both practical ( meeting place ) and ceremonial or religious uses . pottery that has been found near some of these stones suggest some of them in europe belonged to the so-called 'beaker culture ' . their shape is generally uneven and squared , often tapering towards the top . menhirs can be found across europe , africa and asia , but they are most numerous in western europe ; in particular in the british isles ( great britain and ireland ) , and brittany . there are about 50,000 megaliths in these areas . standing stones are usually difficult to date , but pottery found underneath some in western europe connects them with the beaker people . they were erected as part of a megalithic culture which flourished in europe and beyond .
