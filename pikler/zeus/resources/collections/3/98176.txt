Jacques Offenbach     jacques offenbach ( 20 june 1819 , in cologne – 5 october 1880 , in paris ) was a french composer and cellist of the romantic era . he is seen as one of the originators of the operetta form . of german-jewish descent , he was one of the most influential composers of popular music in europe in the 19th century . many of his works are still played today . offenbach 's many operettas , such as `` orpheus in the underworld '' , and `` la belle hélène '' , were extremely popular both in france and elsewhere in the 1850s and 1860s . they combined political and cultural satire with witty grand opera parodies . his popularity in france declined in the 1870s after the fall of the second empire . he fled france , but during the last years of his life , his popularity came back . several of his operettas are still performed . while his name remains most closely associated with the french operetta and the second empire , it is offenbach 's one fully operatic masterpiece , `` les contes d'hoffmann '' ( `` the tales of hoffmann '' ) , composed at the end of his career , that has become the most familiar of offenbach 's works in major opera houses .
