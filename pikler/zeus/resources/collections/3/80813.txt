Carbon fiber reinforced plastic     carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( cfrp or crp ) , is a very strong , light and expensive composite material or fiber-reinforced plastic . similar to glass-reinforced plastic , one uses commonly the name of its reinforcing fibers ( carbon fiber ) for the composite material . the plastic is most often epoxy , but other plastics , such as polyester , vinyl ester or nylon , are also sometimes used . some composites contain both carbon fiber and other fibres such as kevlar , aluminium and fiberglass reinforcement . less commonly , the terms graphite-reinforced plastic or graphite fiber reinforced plastic ( gfrp ) are also used . it has many applications in aerospace and automotive fields , as well as in sailboats , and notably in modern bicycles and motorcycles , where these qualities are of importance . it is becoming increasingly common in small consumer goods as well , such as laptop computers , tripods , fishing rods , paintball equipment , racquet sports frames , stringed instrument bodies , classical guitar strings , and drum shells .
