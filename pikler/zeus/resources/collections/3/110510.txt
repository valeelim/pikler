Pachacuti     pachacuti inca yupanqui ( or pachacutec ; , whose name means `` he who remakes the world '' was the ninth sapa inca ( 1438-1471/1472 ) of the kingdom of cuzco , which he transformed into an empire , tawantinsuyu . he began the era of conquest that , within three generations , expanded the inca dominion from the valley of cuzco to nearly the whole of civilized south america . he was the fourth of the hanan dynasty , and his wife 's name is given as mama anawarkhi or coya anahurque . their son was tupac inca yupanqui . pachacuti reorganized the new empire , the `` tahuantinsuyu '' or `` the united four provinces . '' under his system , there were four `` apos '' that each controlled one of four provinces ( `` suyu '' ) . despite pachacuti 's political and military talents , he did not improve upon the system of choosing the next inca . his son became the next inca without any known dispute , but in future generations the next inca had to gain control of the empire by winning enough support from the apos , priesthood , and military to either win a civil war or intimidate anyone else from trying to get control of the empire .
