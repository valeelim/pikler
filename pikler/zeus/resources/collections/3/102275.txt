Neanderthal     the neanderthal , a species of the genus `` homo '' , was a near relative of our own species . its scientific name is `` homo neanderthalensis '' or `` homo sapiens neanderthalensis '' . neanderthal fossils are only found in europe , asia minor and up to central asia . the first fossil was found in a limestone quarry near d√ºsseldorf : one of the workers found part of a skeleton , in a valley called neanderthal . experts johann carl fuhlrott and hermann schaaffhausen said the bones belonged to an older form of modern humans . these bones are known as neanderthal 1 today . recent research suggests neanderthals became extinct about 40,000 years ago . earlier research had suggested a later date ; the problem is the dating of the archaeological sites where their remains have been found . neanderthals perhaps evolved from `` homo heidelbergensis '' and split off ( last common ancestor ) from modern humans between 700,000 and 300,000 years ago . neanderthals used to be classified as a subspecies of modern humans ( `` homo sapiens neanderthalensis '' ) . now , they are usually classified as a separate human species ( `` homo neanderthalensis '' ) .
