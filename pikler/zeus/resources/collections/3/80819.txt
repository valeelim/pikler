Physical coefficient     a physical coefficient is an important number that characterizes some physical property of a technical or scientific object . examples of physical coefficients . 1 . `` coefficient of thermal expansion '' ( thermodynamics ) ( dimensionless ) - relates the change in temperature to the change in a material 's dimensions . 1 . `` partition coefficient '' ( `` k '' ) ( chemistry ) - the ratio of concentrations of a compound in two phases of a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium . 1 . `` hall coefficient '' ( electrical physics ) - relates a magnetic field applied to an element to the voltage created , the amount of current and the element thickness . it is a characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made . 1 . `` lift coefficient '' ( `` c '' or `` c '' ) ( aerodynamics ) ( dimensionless ) - relates the lift generated by an airfoil with the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around the airfoil , and the planform area of the airfoil . 1 . `` ballistic coefficient '' ( bc ) ( aerodynamics ) ( units of kg/mÂ² ) - a measure of a body 's ability to overcome air resistance in flight . bc is a function of mass , diameter , and drag coefficient .
