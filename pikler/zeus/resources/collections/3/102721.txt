Confederate States Army     the confederate states army ( csa ) was organized in february 1861 to defend the newly formed confederate states of america during the american civil war . somewhere between 750,000 and 1.2 million soldiers served the confederacy in one form or another . the exact numbers are not known because of incomplete and destroyed records . although it won a large number of battles the confederate army was not able to win the war . it could not overcome the union army 's larger numbers and better resources . on april 9 , 1865 , general robert e. lee surrendered what was left of the army of northern virginia to general ulysses s. grant at appomattox court house , virginia . while his army was only a part of the total confederate army , his surrender marked the end of the confederacy . on june 23 , 1865 , georgia 's stand watie became the last confederate general to surrender . much of the design of the confederate states army was based on the structure and customs of the u.s. army . both armies consisted mainly of infantry , cavalry and artillery units . while the structure of the two armies was almost the same , the sizes of the units within the army varied . many confederate officers were graduates of west point just like union officers . regiments were usually numbered and named for the state where they were first organized and where most of the soldiers came from . brigades were usually named after their commanders ( past or present ) . for example , the stonewall brigade was named for its commanding general , stonewall jackson .
