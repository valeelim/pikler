Eastern Front (World War I)    eastern front ( world war i ) the eastern front of world war i was the theatre in which germany and austria-hungary fought russia . this front had more troops than the western front but was at least three and up to five times longer than it , meaning that planning where to concentrate your forces was very important because you could only transfer and reinforce your forces very slowly compared to on the western front . russia lost a lot of battles , but her overall situation improved as she improved her forces and more and more allies entered the war on her side . the eastern front ended when the russian civil war broke out between the communists and russian social-democratic party in 1917 and the communists signed a peace treaty with germany so they could focus on winning the civil war . other websites . - wwi eastern front photo . - wwi eastern front part ii - with the russian army , 1914-1917 by alfred knox
