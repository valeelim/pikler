History of Europe     the history of europe means all the time when humans lived in the european continent up to the present day . the first evidence of `` homo sapiens '' in europe dates back to 35,000 bc . europe 's antiquity ( ancient time ) dates from homer 's `` iliad '' in ancient greece of around 700 bc . the roman republic was established in 509 bc , which was usurped by octavian 's new roman empire at its first century bc peak . the christian religion was adopted in the fourth century , and in the sixth was organized , within the empire , by emperor justinian i ( 527â€“565 ) with five most important cities : rome , constantinople , antioch , jerusalem and alexandria . the fall of the western roman empire was followed by a decline of western europe . the byzantine empire kept civilization in the east . a schism within the church 's authority in 1054 was added to the earlier division that had persisted since 451 and was followed by crusades from west to rescue the holy land from muslim invasion . feudal society began to break down , as the mongol invaders carried the black death with them . constantinople fell in 1453 , showing the military weakness of the christians in eastern europe , yet the new world was discovered by western european christians in 1492. europe awoke from the medieval period through rediscovery of classical learning , much of which had been kept alive in the muslim world while the western church had rejected lots of it as paganry . the renaissance was followed by the protestant reformation , as german priest martin luther attacked papal authority . the thirty years war , the treaty of westphalia and the glorious revolution laid the basis for a new era of expansion and enlightenment .
