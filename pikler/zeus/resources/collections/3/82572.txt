16 Psyche     16 psyche is a very big main belt asteroid , well over 200 kilometers in diameter , and likely the biggest of the metallic m-type asteroids . it is estimated to have 0.6 percent of the mass of the entire asteroid belt . this asteroid was found by annibale de gasparis on march 17 , 1852 from naples and named after the greek nymph psyche . the first fifteen asteroids to be found were given symbols by astronomers as a type of short-hand notation . in 1851 , however , j. f. encke suggested using a circled number . 16 psyche was the first new asteroid to be found that was designated with this scheme ( in 1852 by j. ferguson ) . radar observations indicate that it is made of iron-nickel . psyche appears to be a case of an exposed metallic core from a bigger differentiated parent body . unlike some other m-type asteroids , psyche shows no sign of the presence of water or water-bearing minerals on its surface , consistent with its interpretation as a metallic body . small amounts of pyroxene appear to be present .
