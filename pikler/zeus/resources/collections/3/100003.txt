Peace of Westphalia     the peace of westphalia refers to the pair of treaties , the treaty of osnabrück and the treaty of münster , signed on may 15 and october 24 of 1648 , which ended both the thirty years ' war and the eighty years ' war . the treaties involved the holy roman emperor , ferdinand iii habsburg , the other german princes , spain , france , sweden and representatives of the dutch republic . the treaty of the pyrenees , signed in 1659 , ending the war between france and spain , is also often considered part of the overall accord . the peace negotiations were held in the cities of münster and osnabrück , which lie about 50 km apart from each other , in the present day german states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony . sweden had favoured osnabrück due to its protestant background , france chose münster due to its catholic background . in any case two locations were required because protestant and catholic leaders refused to meet each other . the catholics used münster , while the protestants used osnabrück .
