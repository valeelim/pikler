Protactinium     protactinium is a chemical element with the symbol pa and atomic number 91. protactinium is a silver metallic element that is in the actinide group , with a bright metallic shine that it keeps for some time in the air . it is superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 k. due to its scarcity , high radioactivity and toxicity , there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of basic research . protactinium-231 ( which is made by the alpha decay of uranium-235 followed by beta decay of thorium-231 ) could possibly sustain a nuclear chain reaction and might be used to build a nuclear weapon . the critical mass , according to walter seifritz , is 750±180 kg . other authors conclude that no chain reactions are possible in protactinium-231 . protactinium was first discovered in 1913 , when kasimir fajans and o. h. göhring encountered short-lived isotope 234m-pa , with a half-life of about 1.17 minutes , while they were studying the decay chain of 238-u . they gave the new element the name `` brevium '' ( latin `` brevis '' , brief , short ) ; the name was changed to `` protoactinium '' in 1918 when two groups of scientists ( otto hahn and lise meitner of germany and frederick soddy and john cranston of the uk ) independently discovered 231-pa. the name was shortened to `` protactinium '' in 1949 .
