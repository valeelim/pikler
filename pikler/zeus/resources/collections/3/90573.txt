Pieter Brueghel the Elder     pieter brueghel the elder ( c. 1525 â€“ 9 september 1569 ) was a dutch or flemish renaissance painter and printmaker . he is known for his landscapes and peasant scenes . he is nicknamed 'peasant bruegel ' to distinguish him from other members of the brueghel family . but he is the most famous of them and therefore in most of the cases when someone speaks of `` brueghel '' he thinks of him . from 1559 he dropped the 'h ' from his name and started signing his paintings as bruegel . there are records that he was born in breda , netherlands , but it is uncertain whether the dutch town of breda or the belgian town of bree , called breda in latin , is meant . he was the son of a peasant living in the village of breughel . in bruegel 's later years he painted in a simpler style than the italian art in his time . the most obvious influence on his art is the older dutch master hieronymus bosch . bruegel specialized in landscapes populated by peasants . he is often credited as being the first western painter to paint landscapes for their own sake .
