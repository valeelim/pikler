Strike action     a strike action ( or simply a strike ) is when a large number of workers stop working in protest . strikes are usually done by a labor union to get better pay , hours , or working conditions . they became important during the industrial revolution , when many worked in factories and mines . in many countries , it is against the law to strike . in other countries , people who strike are protected under certain conditions . strikes generally take the form of a picket line . the workers walk in front of where they work , chanting and holding signs . workers on strike usually do not stop people from crossing the picket line . however , some people will not cross a picket line to buy something from the company . this is a way of showing solidarity ( or support ) for the union . most unions will also not cross a picket line and do business with companies on strike . for example , members of the teamsters , a truck driving union , will not deliver to a business that is on strike . the first known strike was in the 12th century b.c. , in egypt . workers under ramses iii stopped working on the necropolis until they were treated better . the word gets its name from modern times : in 1768 , sailors in london `` struck '' or removed the sails of trade ships at port .
