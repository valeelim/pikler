Particle size (general)    particle size ( general ) the term particle size is used to compare dimensions of different small material objects . larger objects are usually called stone , rock , a piece of something , etc . the term `` particle '' indicates small size , usually less than centimeter . particle might be either solid , or liquid , or even gas . liquid particles are called `` droplets '' . gaseous particles are `` bubbles '' . all of them can be characterised in terms of size . - particle size of spherical object equals to its diameter . but a typical material object is likely to be irregular in shape . this causes ambiguity in definition of `` particle size '' . existing definitions are based on replacent of a given particle with imaginary sphere that has one of the properties identical with the particle . - volume based particle size equals to the diameter of the sphere that has same volume as a given particle ; - weight based particle size equals to the diameter of the sphere that has same weight as a given particle ; - area based particle size equals to the diameter of the sphere that has the same surface area as a given particle ;
