617 Patroclus     617 patroclus `` ( pə-troe'-kləs , '' ) is a binary minor planet made up of two similarly-sized objects orbiting their common centre of gravity . it is a trojan , sharing an orbit with jupiter . it was found in 1907 by august kopff , and was the second trojan asteroid to be found . recent evidence suggests that the objects are icy comets , rather than rocky asteroids . patroclus orbits in jupiter 's trailing lagrangian point , l , in an orbit called the 'trojan node ' after one of the sides in the legendary trojan war ( the other node is called the 'greek node ' ) . patroclus is the only object in the trojan camp to be named after a greek character ; the naming rules for the trojan asteroids were not made until after patroclus was named ( similarly , the asteroid hektor is the only trojan character to appear in the greek camp ) . in 2001 , it was found that patroclus is a binary object , made up of two asteroids which are almost the same size . in february , 2006 , a team of astronomers led by franck marchis measured accurately the orbit of the system using the keck laser guide star adaptive optics system . they thought that the two asteroids orbit around their center of mass in 4.283±0.004 d at a distance of 680±20 km , describing a close to circular orbit . putting together their sightings with thermal measurements taken in november 2000 , the team thought what the size of the asteroids of the system could be . the slightly bigger asteroids , which measures 122 km in diameter , continues to have the name patroclus . the smaller asteroid , measuring 112 km , is now named menoetius ( full name ( 617 ) patroclus i menoetius ) , after the legendary patroclus 's father . its provisional designation was s/2001 ( 617 ) 1 .
