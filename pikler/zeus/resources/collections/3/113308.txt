Domaaki language     domaakí - also known as dumaki or domaá - is a language spoken in the northern areas of pakistan . it is the traditional tongue of the dóoma ( sg . dóom ) , a small ethnic group scattered in extended family units among larger host communities . in former times , domaaki speakers traditionally worked as blacksmiths and musicians , but nowadays they are also engaged in a variety of other professions . in almost all places of their present settlement the dooma , who are all muslims , have long since given up their original mother tongue in favour of the language of their respective host community . only in the nager and hunza valleys has domaaki survived until the present day . following its geographic location , domaaki can be divided into two dialects : nager-domaaki and hunza-domaaki . although there are considerable differences between these two varieties , they are not so severe as to prevent mutual intelligibility . presently domaaki counts less than 350 ( mostly elderly ) speakers – ca . 300
