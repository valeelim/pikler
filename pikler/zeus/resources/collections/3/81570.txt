Thebe (moon)    thebe ( moon ) thebe or ' , is the fourth of jupiter 's known moons ( by distance from the planet ) . it was found by stephen p. synnott in images from the `` voyager 1 '' space probe taken on march 5 , 1979 and was given the designation ' . later , it was found on images dating back to february 27 , 1979. in 1983 it was officially named after the mythological nymph thebe who was the daughter of the river god asopus and a lover of zeus ( the greek equivalent of jupiter ) . thebe is the farthest of the inner jovian moons . it orbits jupiter at a distance of ~222,000 km ( 3.11 jupiter radii ) . the orbit of thebe has an orbital eccentricity of ~0.018 and an inclination of ~1.08° relative to the equator of jupiter . these values are unusually high for a closer moon and can be explained by the past influence of the closest galilean satellite io ; in the past , several mean motion resonances with io would have passed through thebe 's orbit as io gradually moved away from jupiter , and these excited thebe 's orbit . thebe is not a sphere , with the closest ellipsoidal approximation being 116x98x84 km . its bulk density and mass are not known but assuming that it mean density is like that of amalthea ( ~0.86 g/cm³ ) its mass can be estimated at ~4.3×10 kg .
